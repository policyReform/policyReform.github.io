        <h1>I. Comparative Analysis of Individual Sports within the NCAA</h1>


        <div id="lessonslearned" class="trackIt"></div>
        <h5>Lessons Learned: Drawing on the Success of other NCAA Individual Sports</h5>
        <p>The NCAA sponsors and conducts numerous sports and championships, each with its own unique policies,
            proposals, and structures. This provides a laboratory for natural experiments within the collegiate
            framework. By reviewing all of these sports and drawing on lessons learned from each one, it is possible to
            build a holistic model that serves the various stakeholders in wrestling, based on established best
            practices. This approach will require the least significant changes to NCAA policy or administration to allow for expedited adoption of any changes.</p>



        <p>This excercise will provide insight into how different sports have addressed structuring competition and
            championships for these individual sports.</p>
        <p>The analysis will be limited to a high level comparison of the basic frameworks utilized for NCAA individual
            sports at Division I schools.</p>

        <div id="types" class="trackIt"></div>
        <h3>A. Types of Individual Sports</h3>
        <p>The selected sports to be included within the review will be the those sports defined by the NCAA as
            individual
            sports within the NCAA Manual <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="2021-22 NCAA Division-I Manual, 17.02.18.2 Individual Sports.">(17.02.18.2)</cite>.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the NCAA's definition and taxonomy used deviates from the standards established by
            researchers and scholars when classifying sports.</p>
        <p>While there are various classifications used for sport, depending on the objective of the research (<cite
                data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                title="Shared Space: How North American Olympic Broadcasters Framed Gender on Instagram.">Johnson, et

            common high level classifications each break
            sports into three distinct groups:</p>

                <li><i>Dual Sports</i> - Sports in which opponents compete against each other head-to-head without the
                    support of a team structure in the competition.  Examples: Badminton, Fencing, Squash, Tennis, <u>Wrestling</u>.</li>
                <li><i>Team Sports</i> - Sports where two opposing teams of competitors compete head-to-head.  Examples:

            </ul>
        </ol>



        <p>In order to best categorize the sports within the NCAA model, a different categorization of the sports has
            been developed for this specific use case drawing on the framework developed by the methods listed above.
        </p>

        <h5 id="standard" class="trackIt">1. Standards-Based Sports</h5>

        <p>Within these sports an athlete will compete against a standard (score, time, distance, etc.) with
            those
            standards compared to other athletes to determine standing within the competition. This group is further
            broken
            down into two subsets based on how
            those sports conduct competition:</p>
        <ul>
            <h5>Individual Competition, Standards-Based</h5>

            <p><i>Sports where athletes compete to establish a standard individually (one at a time, or in a specific
                    lane free from opponents). This standard is then used to compare their performance against other
                    athletes at
                    an event or nationally to determine the success of the athlete in competition.</p>
            <p>It would be possible for an athlete to
                compete in this sport to establish a standard without an opponent being present and it could accurately
                represent the ability of the athlete. In these sports, the standard can
                often be compared not only against athletes at the event or nationally but also across athletes from
                different seasons of competition due to the uniformity of the conditions in which an athlete
                competes to establish a standard.</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bowling</li>
                <li>Gymnastics</li>
                <li>Rifle</li>
                <li>Skiing</li>
                <li>Swimming and Diving</li>
                <li>Track and Field (Indoor)</li>
                <li>Track and Field (Outdoor)</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h5>Co-Competition, Standards-Based</h5>

            <p><i>Sports where athletes compete alongside multiple athletes at the same time and in doing so may end up
                    impeding the progress of others while everyone competing is trying to be the best performer against
                    the standard.</p>
            <p>Though athletes could compete in this sport without an opponent, competition is designed to
                compete on a course that includes multiple athletes at a time.</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cross Country</li>
                <li>Golf</li>
                <li>Track (Indoor) - Distance events only</li>
                <li>Track (Outdoor) - Distance events only</li>
                <li>Triathlon</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h5 id="Competitor" >2. Competitor Dependent</h5>
        <p><i>Sports where athletes compete directly against an opponent. There is no standard in which an athlete is
                measured but rather an athlete's goal is to defeat their individual opponent directly. Competition
                is not
                possible
                without opponent engagement.</i></p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Fencing</li>
                <li>Tennis</li>
                <li>Wrestling</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>As a direct competition individual sport, wrestling is dependent on having a competitor in a way most
            individual sports are not. Tennis and Fencing are the only other individual sports where direct competition

        <h3>B. Regular Season Competition</h3>

        <p>Regular Season competition for individual sport is divided into two distinctly different groups
            based
            on how each sport documents and recognizes competitions between opposing teams.</p>
        <ul>
            <h5>Team Win Loss Records Not Maintained</h5>
            <p>These are sports that are conducted as a collection of individual competitions. For these sports, teams
                do not record wins or loses based on their competitions throughout the season, though they may
                sometimes compete in events with only one other team in attendance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cross Country</li>
                <li>Golf<sup>1</sup></li>
                <li>Skiing</li>
                <li>Track and Field (Indoor)</li>
                <li>Track and Field (Outdoor)</li>
                <p style="font-size: small"><sup>1</sup>Men's golf records win loss records from multi-team events for
                    administrative
                    selection purposes only. This is
                    known colloquially as <i>the 500 rule</i>.</p>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Team Win Loss Records Maintained</h5>
            <p>Sports maintaining team head-to-head win loss records list their team win loss records on their athletic
                website
                and hold
                team head-to-head direct competitions against another team in a dual competition format.</p>
            <p>A primary characteristic of this group is that they hold competitions where a winning team in a
                head-to-head competition will record a win on the team's record and the losing team will record a loss
                (though ties may also be recorded depending on the sport).</p>

            </ul>
            <br>

            <h5>Analysis</h5>

            <p>While half of the individual sports maintain team win loss records and hold competitions in a head-
                to-head format between teams, there is significant variation in how formal the structure is
                within the sports maintaining win loss records.</p>

            <p>Most of these sports have formalized the direct head-to-head competition format within their
                rulebooks
                with
                established policies and procedures for administering and scoring these competitions, though not every
                individual program has adopted the recognition of these results on the team basis and utilizes the team
                win loss record.</p>
            <p>The following sports use direct head-to-head team competitions during the season but
                there is not a culture of widespread adoption of the team win loss record; some
                programs (including nationally ranked programs) choose not to acknowledge dual team results within their
                schedules, media releases, or results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fencing</li>
                <li>Gymnastics</li>
                <li>Swimming and Diving</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Furthermore, the definition of direct head-to-head competition, as adopted within Gymnastics,
                is less rigid compared to other sports.</p>
            <p>While records are maintained for the head-to-head competitions with other teams, Men's Gymnastics permits
                Virtual Dual Meets in which two teams compete against one another through a video feed from each team's
                home venue. This system allows for athletes to compete at their home facility, without ever needing to
                be in the same
                facility as their opponents, while being judged for their individual performances by the same judge(s)
                remotely.
            </p>
            <p>It wasn't until the 2021-22 Season when NCAA Men's Gymnastics formalized dual meets
                in the rulebook as a direct head-to-head competition. It was at this time that the sport adopted the
                requirement for opposing teams to alternate their
                performance on each event to maximize the team competition aspect. This change
                sought to make
                it easier for fans to follow
                team competitions <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Dual meet format, team scoring modified in men's gymnastics">(<i>Johnson, 2021</i>)</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>Though Women's gymnastics logs team results for all dual (two teams), triangular (three teams),
                and quad (four team) meets on team records only dual meets are a direct head-to-head with alternating
                team
                competition within an
                event. (Example: A quad event would have the fourth-place team in the final standings finish 0-3 since
                they scored below three other teams--despite not facing those teams head-to-head in the dual competition
                format.)</p>
            <p>Despite the formalization of head-to-head team competitions within individual sports, only
                three sports have adopted the use of rankings specifically for head-to-head team competition utilized by
                member schools and reported on the NCAA website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fencing <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="Division I Fencing Rankings">(National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d. -p)</cite>
                </li>
                <li>Tennis <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="Division I Men's Tennis Rankings">(National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.
                        -o)</cite></li>
                <li>Wrestling <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="Division I, College Wrestling Rankings: NWCA Coaches Poll">(National Collegiate Athletic
                        Association, n.d. -q)</cite>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <p>While many individual sports utilize the team head-to-head competition format, the
                adoption of ranking based on these direct head-to-head competitions is unique to
                competitor dependent sports.</p>


            <p>It's logical for competitor dependent sports to have an increased emphasis on head-to-head matchups as
                these sports
                are dependent on specific matchups between teams and individuals. While in standards-based
                sports the team rankings are largely
                a comparison of individual athletes within each sport's standard metric and attributing a points
                value to the individual athlete's national standing. The individual matchups between individual athletes
                that may take place within a competition are of little significance for standards-based sports.</p>
            <p>Without standards to rank against, the team ranking based on team competitions and their subsequent
                results becomes more
                valuable
                for fans. As is the case in team sports where the bracketed team advancement format is standard, these
                rankings can deviate from national finish significantly, as championship finish is based on unique
                matchups that athletes
                and teams may, or may not, encounter during competition.</p>

        <h3>C. Athlete Championship Participation</h3>
        <p>Each individual sport where the NCAA sponsors a championship has its own process for qualification to the
            championship(s). Some sports have qualification for teams, others for individual athletes, with many
            having
            qualification for both teams and individuals.</p>

        <h5>Comparison of Individual Sports Qualifications</h5>
        <p>The below table provides a high-level comparison of the qualification processes for each individual sport.
            The table includes information on the number of athletes to
            earn a bid to
            an NCAA Championship by virtue of being a member of a top performing team as well as the number of
            individuals to earn a bid due only to their individual performance. Note: For those sports where the
            individual and team
            championships for the sport are held separately, an athlete could be double counted--once as a team
            qualifier and again as
            an individual qualifier.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Primary Postseason Qualification Method </li>
            <ul>
                <li><Strong>Team Member Qualifier</Strong> - An athlete that has qualified for postseason competition

                    an
                    NCAA Championship because of their team's performance.</li>
                <li><Strong>Individual Qualifier</Strong> - An athlete that has qualified for postseason competition in
                    an
                    NCAA Championship because of their performance as an individual and not due to the performance
                    of
                    their team.</li>
            </ul>

                    <li><strong>Team</strong> - NCAA Championship bids are guaranteed for teams winning a recognized
                        conference's team championship in the sport.</li>
                    <li><strong>--</strong> - the sport does not award NCAA Championship bids for conference
                        championships.</li>

                        <h5>Example of Team Member Qualification</h5>

                        <p>Without a familiarity of other individual sports, it may seem counter-intuitive to learn that
                            many sports, especially
                            those not utilizing a head-to-head dual format would have a qualification process where
                            athletes qualify for the NCAA Championship by virtue of their team's
                            performance.</p>
                        <p>To better illustrate this system in the context of wrestling, the current cross country
                            qualification model will be
                            explored as though it were the qualification system utilized by wrestling withing the
                            current wrestling framework.
                        </p>
                        <p>This process would not change how the wrestling qualification tournaments are conducted or
                            how the NCAA Wrestling Championship is conducted. They each would still be individual
                            tournaments where athletes compete in a bracket and team scores are calculated based on a
                            mathematical formula derived from the results of the individual athletes in the field. The
                            only
                            difference would be which athletes (and teams) advance from the qualifying tournaments to
                            the
                            championship.</p>
                        <p>When applying the Cross Country model, the teams that finished in the qualification tier
                            based on wreslting's
                            mathematical team points scoring system used to determine the team
                            championship would qualify their team to the NCAA Championships.</p>



                        <p>For this example, each wrestling qualifier would be designated as either a large
                            qualifier or a small qualifier. This distinction would dilineate events based on the number
                            of participating teams and would determine the number of teams and individuals to earn
                            automatic bids at the event. Any event with seven or fewer participating teams would be
                            classified as a small qualifier with all other events being classified as a large qualifier.
                        </p>


                        <h6>Team Automatic Qualification</h6>



                        <p>Any team to win the qualifying event's team championship (utilizing the current wrestling
                            team scoring rules) earns automatic team qualification for the NCAA Championship. If the
                            event
                            was classified as a large qualifier, the team runner-up would also earn automatic
                            qualification
                            to the NCAA Championship.
                        </p>

                        <p>Automatic qualification for a team means that the team would be entitled to
                            send ten (10) athletes to the NCAA Championship--one in each weight class. These athletes
                            could be any athlete from their roster and need not be the same ones that competed in the
                            qualifying event.</p>
                        <p>Twelve teams would earn automatic bids--accounting for 120 athletes earning bids.</p>

                        <p>Below is the actual results from one of wrestling's large Conference Qualifiers from this
                            season. This represents the placement at the qualifying event for the athletes who would
                            have earned automatic qualification for their team's weight class to the
                            NCAA Championship in 2022 by virtue of their team's performance.</p>

                        </p>

                        <h6>Individual Automatic Qualification</h6>
                        <p>After all team bids have been awarded, individual bids are then given out to the highest
                            placing individuals at each of the
                            qualifying events that are not on a qualified team. Large qualifying events would award
                            twenty bids (two bids at each weight class) and smaller qualifiers would award ten bids (one
                            bid per weight class). </p>
                        <p>Twelve bids would be awarded at each weight class--accounting for 120 athletes earning bids.
                        </p>

                        <p>Example: In the 125 weight division at a large qualifier, the weight's runner-up and third
                            place finisher were members of teams to earn automatic qualification. As a result, the
                            weight's champion and fourth place finisher would each earn individual qualification by
                            virtue of being the highest placed athletes at the weight to not yet earn a bid to the NCAA
                            Championship.</p>

                        <h6>Individual At-Large Qualification</h6>
                        <p>Following the determination of individual auto-bids, at-large bids would be awarded to
                            individuals by the NCAA Wrestling Selection Committee. These bids would be awarded to the
                            most deserving athletes based on their season's performance
                            from any qualifier from the field of athletes who had not yet earned a bid to the NCAA
                            Championship.</p>
                        <p>Two athletes per weight class would earn an individual at-large bid--accounting for 20
                            athletes earning bids.</p>

                        <h6>NCAA Championship</h6>
                        <p>With the field of 330 athletes now selected, the NCAA tournament would be conducted in the
                            current format with each qualified athlete competing.</p>
                        <p>The individuals to win the event would be recognized as National Champions and the best
                            performing team (with all 10 weight classes represented with athletes) would be crowned the
                            NCAA Team Champion using the same mathematical scoring system

        <h5>Analysis</h5>

        <p>Despite the NCAA sponsoring 19 NCAA Division-I National Championships for individual sports,
            individual athlete performance is the primary factor for inclusion in championship competition for only
            eight (8) sports.</p>
        <p>It's common for an athlete, even in individual sports, to be awarded an NCAA Championship opportunity by
            virtue of their team's success.</p>
        <p>This is in part due to the size of teams and needing to include a full line-up of athletes for team
            competition
            to accurately represent the team as opposed to determining a team's performance based on a sampling of a few
            athletes from the team.</p>
        <p>In the sports where championship opportunities are primarily earned based on an athlete's individual
            performance, it is nearly exclusively standards-based sports where the competition is timed. Additionally,
            for many of these sports there are too many events to make team qualification feasible.</p>
        <p>In each individual sport, outside of wrestling, an athlete must be one
            of the top athletes in the country and not simply the best performer in their conference to qualify
            for the national championship based on their individual performance.</p>

        <p>While conference championship teams earning a postseason bid is common in NCAA sports and is the default
            process administrators and fans think of when they think of the qualification process for NCAA
            championships, the process of individual (athlete) conference champions earning bids is an outlier unique
            only to
            wrestling.</p>
        <p>The basic structure utilized by most sports within the NCAA is that conference championships earn teams
            qualification to the championship and individual athletes qualify either directly through season
            qualification or through a regional qualifier.</p>

        <h5>Analysis</h5>
        <h6>Conclusive Championships</h6>
        <p>Most team championships in individual sports are determined by calculating a team score based
            on the placement of individual athletes at the competition. This system has been widely adopted for its
            ease of implementation and
            administration.</p>
        <p>While this system is easily implemented and allows for a team competition to be overlaid upon individual
            competition, one of the major drawbacks of this system is the lack of a guarantee that there will be a conclusive championship winner.</p>
        <p>The placement based scoring systems have a propensity for ties. While
            ties have
            happened in many sports at the NCAA Championships using the placement based points system, resulting in no
            conclusive Champion being determined, the 1970 NCAA Men's
            Outdoor Track and Field
            Championship is notably the only instance where three schools (BYU, Kansas, and Oregon) tied to share a
            single NCAA Team Championship
            <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Outdoor Track and Field Championship
                Records.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d. -d)</cite>.
        </p>
        <h6>Team Composition</h6>
        <p>The main delineator between individual sports using the placement based process is in what constitutes a
            team.
        </p>
        <p>Some sports base their
            team championship competition on a complete lineup while other sports, like wrestling, base the team
            competition on only a subset of
            competitors that have qualified for the championship. Which in turn makes the
            qualification, or lack of qualification, of an athlete have a
            direct and potentially significant impact on the subsequent team results at the national championships.</p>
        <p>For every sport, other than wrestling, where team championships are determined based on only a subset of
            competitors, qualification is determined at a national level through uniform standards (time, distance,
            etc), or through regional qualification (Regionals, Zones, Pre-Championship) events.</p>

        <p>This makes wrestling a significant outlier as it does not determine qualification based on national standards
            or regional placement but rather on conference placement.</p>

        <p>Since conference affiliation is self-selected by each school, or by each individual team as is largely the case
            within wrestling where 58% of wrestling programs are affiliate members of conferences, this means that
            individual teams have a great deal of freedom to select their conference membership specifically based on
            the path that such conference membership will give their athletes in qualifying for the national
            championships.</p>
        <p>The sports where only a subset of a team's lineup will compete within the team competition are
            nearly exclusively sports where the competition is timed. The only sports not timed to determine team
            standings based on only a subset of athletes from a team are Fencing and Wrestling. Though Fencing utilizes regional qualifiers where competition is conducted within a full round-robin format which produces a complete result against the field. This makes the final placements of athletes at the Fencing regional championships more similar to
            the placements within a timed race and less opponent dependent than wrestling's advancement tournaments.</p>
        <h6>Competition Consistency</h6>
        <p>It's notable to mention that some individual sports lack consistency in their team competition methods.
            Several sports use a championship method that is different than the primary competition
            method
            utilized during the season. Wrestling and Fencing are the only sports to emphasize team competition during
            the regular season but shift to an individual format for determining team championships. While Golf does the
            inverse and does not use the team competition format during the regular season but uses the method for
            determining the team champion.</p>

        <p>Though the Fencing National Team Championship is determined within an individual

        <p>This creates the unique sitution where the two major championships (conference and NCAA) are conducted under

        <p>This deviation in championship formas is the result of programs within
            conferences setting their prefered competition format for their championships, while not all NCAA fencing
            programs belong to a conference.</p>

        <p>Moreover, in the ACC, Central Collegiate Conference, and Ivy League, the conference championships exhibit an even greater departure from the norm. These conferences segregate their teams by gender, resulting in separate women's and men's team championships, despite fencing being a coed sport within the NCAA (<cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

        <h3>E. Adjustment of Results for Ineligible Athletes</h3>
        <p>For individual sports, when an athlete, who competed at an NCAA Championship, is ruled ineligible, the
            remedy is to vacate that athlete's results from the championship results <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            Depending on the sport, there are two possible additional considerations based on the unique nature of those
            sports and how the championships are administered.

        <ul>
            <h5>Placement and Results Altered</h5>
            <p>Individual Sports where the placement of athletes is adjusted after the vacation of an ineligible
                athlete's
                results.</p>

            <h5>Placement and Results Not Altered</h5>
            <p>Individual Sports where placement of athletes or teams will NOT be adjusted if there is an ineligible

        </ul>

        <br>
        <h5>Analysis</h5>
        <p>Three of the four sports that do not adjust team scores or placements when an ineligible athlete competes in
            a championship are sports classified earlier as
            competitor dependent sports where direct matchups are necessary to conduct competition and thus makes it
            difficult to simply omit an athlete's results as their omission would impact subsequent results.</p>
        <p>The only other sport that does not alter results for ineligible athletes is Women's Bowling which is one of
            the few standards-based sports to utilize a bracketed team competition with head-to-head results determining
            the
            national champion.</p>

        <p>As a result of using the head-to-head team competition and bracket, the competition for Women's Bowling is
            competitor dependent in nature. This makes all competitor dependent Championship formats run the risk of not
            having a recognized champion should an ineligible athlete compete. </p>

        <div id="primaryComparisons" class="trackIt"></div>
        <h3>F. Primary Comparisons</h3>
        <p>Based on the analysis of individual sports there are a few sports that share the most structural qualities
            with wrestling.</p>
        <ul>
            <h5>Fencing</h5>
            <p>The sport that best aligns with wrestling is fencing.</p>
            <p>Both sports are competitor dependent and primarily compete in dual meets during the season before
                pivoting to an individual model for the postseason. Postseason qualification is only for individual
                athletes without any consideration for team membership and a mathematical model is used for determining
                the team title based on the results of the subset of athletes who compete at the championships.</p>
            <p>While fencing uses a regional model for qualification through four regional qualifiers, the wrestling
                model is technically conference centric as it is written. But in application, with only seven wrestling
                conferences and a qualification system that awards different numbers of bids to each conference, the
                system mirrors fencing's regional model almost directly. Both sports have an average of 11 teams at
                each qualifier. </p>
            <p>The individual centric model of the two sports is nearly identical.</p>
            <p>The competition format at the championship would be the most significant difference with wrestling
                utilizing an advancement tournament and fencing using round-robin pools that advance into a round-robin
                finals.</p>
            <p>However, both championship formats are individual centric formats that overlay a team score to implement
                a team championship aspect for the event.</p>

            <h5>Tennis</h5>
            <p>Tennis is the sport that next best aligns with the structure of wrestling.</p>
            <p>The major difference between wrestling and tennis is that tennis has chosen to adopt a team centric
                model and continue that structure through the postseason.
            </p>

            <p>While tennis still has an individual championship, there is also an additional team championship, held
                seperatley, based on dual
                competitions and qualification to the event is awarded based on a team's conference dual results during
                the
                season.</p>
            <p>Outside of the method for crowning the team champion, however, tennis and wrestling are very similar.</p>
            <p>Tennis individual (singles and doubles) qualification is earned by being one of the best in the country
                compared to
                the qualification system in wrestling which is based on your conference affiliation and the depth of the
                talent in the conference tournament.</p>
            <p>Tennis's structure is team centric throughout the season though there are opportunities for individual
                competition in a portion of the season, much like that of wrestling where most individual competitions
                are not team
                scored events.</p>
            <p>The tennis structure mirrors that of other NCAA team sports such as basketball, soccer, lacrosse,
                volleyball, baseball/softball which are structures that athletic departments are familiar with and
                allows them to gauge performance more easily against established metrics.</p>
            <p>The tennis championship structure is unique insofar as there are two separate championship
                events held at the end of the season. The team championship and the individual championships are each
                conducted at the end of the season with each having
                their own
                qualification processes. While wrestling simply overlays the team championship onto the individual
                championship for only one championship event.</p>

        <h3>G. Historic Changes to Championship Formats</h3>
        <p>Throughout the history of NCAA Championships, in all sports, there have been format changes made. Most are
            minor changes such as the field size, qualification methods, or a move to (or away from) a conference or
            regional system.
        </p>
        <p>However, for individual sports, there have been a few changes that have been significant. Many of these were
            viewed as
            bold changes at the time they were implemented and there was great concern about the risks with making such
            changes.</p>
        <ul>
            <div id="historicMTen" class="trackIt"></div>
            <li><strong>NCAA Men's Tennis Championship</strong></li>
            <p>Prior to 1977, the NCAA Men's Tennis Team Champion was determined based on a calculated point system
                derived
                from the number of wins individual athletes from each school earned throughout the championship <cite
                    title="Division I Men's Tennis Championship History.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,
                    n.d. -z)</cite>. This
                system
                had been in use for 30 years, following the adoption in 1946. And on two occasions resulted in
                co-national champions when teams tied for the top spot in the points standings.</p>

            <p>Despite the tradition of the system, the sport's membership decided to take a team centric view
                for the team
                competition and have the team title determined based on a bracketed
                single-elimination tournament of the top-16
                teams through a dual-match format.</p>
            <p>The adopted model proved to be successful. Not only was the format well recieved by athletes and coaches,
                but the championship attendance at the finals climbed from 5,770 in the last year of the individual
                centric format to 16,069 in the first year of the team dual format <cite
                    title="Division I Men's Tennis Championship History.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,
                    n.d. -z)</cite>. With the best attended championship coming in 1993 when Stanford defeated the host
                Georgia 5-3 in front of 34,184 fans.</p>
            <p>The Division I championship field continued to expand until 1999 when
                the field settled into its current format of 64 teams <cite
                    title="Navy to Play North Carolina in NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament.">(Patriot League, 2022)</cite>.
                Teams now compete only once a day over the event
                with most of the championship matches being held on the campus of the higher seeded team <cite
                    title="Teams announced for 2022 NCAA Division I men’s tennis championship.">(National Collegiate
                    Athletic Association, 2022m)</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>When the NCAA started conducting Women's Tennis Championships in 1982, the dual-match format was adopted
                as
                the method for determining the team champion and the field also grew to reach the current 64 team field
                <cite title="Division I Women's Tennis Championship History.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,
                    n.d. -y)</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>In 1983, Division II and Division III Men's Tennis followed the lead taken by Division I seven years
                prior and the Division I Women the year before when they abandoned the individual-centric model (<cite
                    title="Division II Men's Tennis Championship Records Book.">National Collegiate Athletic
                    Association, n.d. -aa; </cite> <cite
                    title="Division III Men's Tennis Championship Records Book.">National Collegiate Athletic
                    Association, n.d. -ab; </cite>). All NCAA Tennis Championships have utilized the dual team format
                for determining their team champions ever since.</p>

            <p>Based on the interviews conducted with Division I Tennis Coaches, this model of team qualification and
                competition (conference
                team champion automatic qualification to a single elimination national tournament) helps administrators
                to better understand
                the tennis program without needing to understand tennis. While the individual championship, conducted at
                a different date and location than the team championship provides an avenue for individuals
                to compete for their own national championships, ensuring that individual athletes are not dependent on
                their team's performance for individual honors.</p>
            <p>There are still a handful of active NCAA tennis coaches who either coached or competed under the old
                individual-centric system.</p>

            <li><strong>NCAA Men's Golf Championship</strong></li>
            <p>For nearly 50 years, the NCAA Men's Golf Team Champion was decided by stroke play, a scoring method where
                each stoke taken by an athlete is counted to determine the athlete's score <cite
                    title="Men's Golf, Championship History.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.
                    -h)</cite>. Team scores are determined
                by taking the sum number of strokes for the four (4) best performing golfers from each team of five (5)
                declared athletes. Best cumulative
                team score is then recognized as the team champion <cite
                    title="How the NCAA men’s and women’s golf championships work">(McDonald, 2019)</cite>.</p>
            <p>Despite the ease of administering this championship there was a desire to get more fan and media
                engagement for collegiate golf.</p>
            <p>A group of college
                coaches felt the sport deserved and could generate more attention than it was receiving and
                thus started a decade
                long push to change the format of the championship to a team centric model with the goal of increasing
                fan engagement <cite title="Since NCAAs adopted match play and attracted Golf Channel,
                college golf has become must-see TV.">(Nichols, 2016)</cite>.</p>
            
            <p>The change that followed was the adoption of a team tournament bracket to determine the team champion.
                While a separate individual
                championship in the traditional stroke play format was preserved to ensure the best individual athletes
                would still be honored <cite
                    title="2022 Division I Men's Golf Championships, Pre-Championship 2021-22 Manual">(National
                    Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d. -g)</cite>.</p>

            <p>This proposal created factions within college golf with many coaches being vocal in their support or opposition.</p>

            <p>In this new team model, the top eight teams as determined based on play in early rounds of the
                championship were seeded in a bracket and would compete head-to-head in a
                single
                elimination advancement tournament utilizing match play rules to determine the champion.</p>
            <p>Under this scoring model, each team declares five players. For each match, one player from each
                team is matched with a player from the opposing team to play head-to-head against each other. The lowest
                score on each hole wins the hole. The golfer to win the most holes at the end of the round
                earns one team point. The team to win three out of five individual matches is declared the head-to-head
                team
                winner <cite title="Men's golf championship gets a makeover">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,

            <p>The team to win the quarter-final, semi-final, and finals in this head-to-head team competition format is

                National
                Champion.</p>
            <p>Though a controversial move at the time, the implementation of the team bracket in 2009 for head-to-head
                team competition is viewed as an overwhelming success within collegiate golf <cite

            <p>Despite achieving the desired goals, those within college golf openly acknowledge that there are doubts
                the

            <p>The new championship process of determining the national team championship is based on a smaller sample
                size of holes and thus is more likely to skew from the result in the
                longer format of stroke play.

            <p>For some people this is a feature of the system. Golf often had teams entering the championship that were
                expected to win the National Championship. And the team race would often be anti-climatic when the team
                race was decided early by a large margin <cite

                provides more drama and more excitement. Not only are upsets more likely in the format but the format
                does not have competition continuing when the team result is already decided. The competition ends with
                the deciding result. Meaning the matches always end with a sudden victory.</p>

                decided to adopt a bracketed, head-to-head, team championship for women's

            <p>Based on the observable benefits of the men's and women's NCAA championships, there are now calls for the

            <li><strong>NCAA Fencing</strong></li>
            <p>Prior to the 1990 championship, the NCAA crowned two national champion fencing programs each year, one
                for
                men and one for women. But in 1990 the championships were combined to make the sport coed (<cite
                    title="Penn State Fencing’s Quiet Dynasty.">Doon, 2015;</cite> <cite
                    title="NCAA Fencing Championships (1941 to 2019)">Masin, 2019</cite>). While competition between
                competitors remained gender specific within each event (men vs men; women vs women), the
                team competition was based on the cumulative results of both genders combined.</p>
            <p>This change was significant given that the men's championship had been conducted since 1941 <cite
                    title="USA Fencing: Celebrating 130 Years of Fencing in America">(Jomantas, 2021)</cite> and the
                women's championship since 1982 <cite
                    title="Women's Fencing National Finishes (1982-1989), WSU Fencing National Finishes (1990-present).">(Wayne
                    State Athletics, n.d.)</cite>. But the change was viewed as a possible solution to the problem of
                declining sponsorship and was made in an effort to preserve NCAA championship competition <cite
                    title="Who are those masked men?">(O'Brien, 1990)</cite>.</p>
            <p>By making the sport
                coed, it
                was thought, gender equity could be solved. Program resources could be consolidated (i.e. sharing
                coaches and travel expenses), and thus more programs, specifically men's programs,
                would be preserved by binding the men and women together.
            </p>
            <p>Despite the best of intentions, the proposed benefits of this change never materialized.
                In fact, it created a new and unique problem.</p>

            <p>School administrators made the decision to eliminate or not expand sponsorship for male athletes and
                in doing so eliminated their female athletes from ever being able to compete for a team championship.
            </p>
            <p>A total of 44 NCAA schools sponsor fencing (2021-2022 season), though eleven of these schools,
                one-quarter of all
                schools, are mathematically eliminated from winning a national title even before qualification
                starts. This is as a result of only fielding a team of women. And since there are no teams that only
                field men, the <i>NCAA External Gender Equity
                    Review</i> noted
                this championship structure does not prevent any male athletes from the opportunity to compete for a
                national team championship but prevents many women from the same opportunity <cite
                    title="NCAA External Gender Equity Review, Phase II.">(Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP, 2021-b)</cite>.</p>

            <p>For these women's programs, the team competition is
                not a consideration; the championships are merely
                an individual championship.</p>
            <p>Fencing's unique situation is emblematic of the multitude of factions found within every
                sport and how the decisions made by some, even if well intended, can adversley impact others.</p>

            <p>Some programs within fencing prefer the team-centric model of competing for a team championship while
                other programs are much more focused on individual competitions, be it due to philosophical
                perspectives, budget constraints, or
                administrative directives. These conflicting perspectives make solving the gender equity issues difficult
                while working to satisfy all of the current stakeholder's interests <cite

            <p>After successfully drawing viewers to gymnastics dual meets on the Pac-12 Network and SEC Network, NCAA Women's Gymnastics decided to alter the format of the NCAA Championships by narrowing down the field of teams competing in the finals. In the past, six teams would compete in the finals for the National Championship. However, this process failed to impress media partners and fans who tuned in to watch the NCAA Championship from home <cite

            <p>Following the team scores was difficult due to the imbalance in number of teams and competing events.
                Some teams had byes, or off-rounds, where they wouldn't be
                competing in the rotation. Fans could never be sure of an accurate representation of the
                team standings based on the team scores at any moment in the competition.</p>

            <p>The move to eliminate two teams from the finals and four teams from the semi-finals was one of the rare
                moments when programs proposed and then supprted the decision to diminish opportunities for themselves and their athletes.</p>
                <p>The NCAA carefully considered the implications of eliminating two teams from the finals and four teams from the semi-finals, recognizing that it would restrict opportunities for programs and athletes. However, research indicated that the change would generate more interest in the sport overall, not just in the finals, and would benefit programs that typically wouldn't qualify for the championship. This decision was also buoyed by the addition of a new early round featuring two team play-in dual meets, which expanded opportunities for programs with limited championship experience.</p>
           
            <p>This addition to the championship was made at the request of schools with more limited success who cited
                team qualification
                to the NCAA team championships as a significant accomplish as measured by their athletic departments.
                Participation in the team championship event (as opposed to having an elite athlete qualify for the
                individual
                championship) has
                been viewed as a strong defense against reducing gymnastics program funding or dropping gymnastics
                program all
                together while also aiding in fundraising efforts for the program.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“When faced with making hard decisions, like eliminating a program due to budget issues, it
                            is easier
                            to eliminate a [individual centric] sport carried by a few elite athletes.
                            Upset fans
                            point to the success of those few athletes as proof the program should remain, but a few
                            athletes
                            aren't representative of the state of the program. Those few athletes will find other
                            opportunities
                            to compete, and often with even better programs, so fans won't fight the decision in the way
                            you see when everyone a part of the program feels like they contribute to the success
                            will fight.”</p>

            <p>These competitive first round matchups at the NCAA championship provide a forum for the teams to compete

            <p>Being competitive in the first round of the NCAA Championships or advancing to the second round of the
                tournament increases the perception to key stakeholders of the program that the program is competitive
