        <li><h3 id="Q1">Why change the qualification system to select athletes directly to the NCAA Wrestling
            Championships? (October 30, 2022)</li></h3>
            <p>The selection process for conference pre-allocations is already a proxy for direct selection
                of athletes. This change simply formalizes the process and directly ties the pre-allocated
                bids to the athletes who earned them. Currently athletes are required to compete in the
                conference tournament in order for the conference to retain the bid. This means that the bid
                is for the athlete currently.</p>
            <p>This change eliminates the problematic process of stealing bids and having to defend them.
                There are three main issues with this process:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Only athletes in that specific conference are able to compete for the bid, which
                    unfairly removes opportunities for some athletes based on their conference affiliation
                    while giving greater opportunities to others based on their conference affiliation.</li>
                <li>Athletes in a conference with a lot of allocations must compete in an excessive number
                    of matches just to determine allocations that have no conference placement value for the
                    team (e.g. determining 12th place in a conference tournament). This puts an unreasonable
                    burden on the athletes.
                    The system does not ensure that the top athletes in the country qualify for the NCAA
                    tournament. Qualification is based on performance within a conference rather than a
                    national or regional field of competitors.</li>
                <li>The system does not ensure that the top athletes in the country qualify for the NCAA
                    tournament. Qualification is based on performance within a conference rather than a
                    national or regional field of competitors.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The new direct qualification process rewards athletes who perform at a high level throughout
                the season while representing their team in team competitions. It ensures that the top
                athletes will earn their way into the NCAA Championships. Additionally, it provides an
                avenue for other athletes to earn their own bids to the NCAA individual championship, even
                if they were not selected as direct qualifiers.</p>
            <p>This process also helps to eliminate the issue of injured athletes defaulting out at
                qualifying events in order to preserve their path through an at-large bid. By earning a
                direct qualification, there is no need for these athletes to enter an event when they are
                unable to compete, which improves the integrity of the sport.</p>

            <a href="#QuestionList">Back to Questions</a><li><h3 id="Q2">Why is there a team representation requirement? (November 10, 2022)</li></h3>
            <p>In order to be eligible for the postseason, including the opportunity to win an individual
                national championship or earn All-American honors, athletes must have been a starter for
                their team in at least 45% of team competitions. This requirement is designed to ensure that
                athletes who participate in the postseason are truly starters for their program and have
                contributed to their team's success. The threshold for earning the team representation
                requirement
                is not weight class specific, which means that a team could potentially have up to 22
                athletes who meet the requirement at the end of the season.</p>

                others? (November 22, 2022)</li></h3>
                <p>The direct qualification process is designed to reward the top-performing athletes during the
                    season. These athletes have demonstrated their abilities and deserve a spot in the NCAA
                    Wrestling Championships. In the current system, there is often universal agreement on which
                    athletes are the most deserving of inclusion in the championship. These athletes, if they
                    were to fail to qualify through a conference allocation, would likely be given an at-large
                    bid. The direct qualification process allows these top performers to bypass qualification
                    events, providing an added incentive for athletes to perform during the season.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the direct qualification process provides the opportunity in the schedule to
                    have a dual track postseason process for teams and individuals which improves athlete
                    well-being. Programs competing for an NCAA Team Championship, will not be burdened with a
                    packed schedule of competition and significant increase in matches.</p>
                <p>The top performing programs within team competitions historically are also those that have
                    the greatest number of athletes earning their conferences pre-allocations today. As a
                    result, the number of athletes from teams competing in the NCAA Wrestling (Team)

                Championships? (December 12, 2022)</li></h3>
                <p>This system of individual qualification provides equal opportunities for athletes from all
                    programs, regardless of their conference affiliation. NCAA Rule <i>17.28.5.3 Annual
                        Exemptions, Number of Dates of Competition</i> will continue to allow conferences to
                    hold conference championships without counting a date of competition, if they choose, which
                    could actually increase opportunities for athletes by allowing multiple entries per weight
                    class from each school. This would make college wrestling more inclusive and increase equity
                    among athletes. The current system of qualification, with its regional qualifiers and focus
                    on consolidation, has minimized opportunities for individuals and teams to compete in
                    conference championships. The new system aims to address this issue and create a more fair

                            This is achieved by consolidating athletes who have not earned qualification into regional

                                    they wish to recognize team honors as part of their events.</p>
                
                                <p>This provides flexibility for hosts of individual competitions to structure scoring for
                                    their event in any manner they choose as individual competitions have no impact on team
                                    postseason qualification.</p>
                                <p>By only having one official team scoring method there will be more uniform standards by which
                                    teams are measured and more uniformity in the recognized values attributed to various match
                                    results. This will improve the sport.</p>
            
                                    

            <a href="#QuestionList">Back to Questions</a><li><h3 id="Q10">The team tie-breaker doesn't make much sense why have mini matches? (June 1, 2023)</li></h3>
            <p>A proper process is needed to handle tie-breaking in team competitions, particularly to determine
                team advancement, as the current scorer's table process of tabulating in-match statistics is
                inadequate. Considerable effort has been invested in designing the team tie-breaker, utilizing
                various modeling methods to explore different potential solutions. The aim is to create an
                exciting format that engages athletes, teams, and fans, enabling a meaningful comparison between
                the two teams.</p>

            <p>The proposed format introduces additional competition akin to an overtime period, where athletes
                engage in extra matches to determine the team's overall result. The selection of weight classes
                for this competition is based on matches with the narrowest scoring margins. By doing so, weight
                classes that were most likely to have a different outcome in a rematch are contested, providing
                an opportunity for additional competition among eligible athletes in those weight classes. This
                method uses the most tightly contested weight classes to determine the team results.</p>

            <p>Conducting competition for a complete (two minute long) period allows athletes to compete both on
                the mat and on
                their feet, offering opportunities to earn points towards their team's victory without being
                confined to a single specific aspect of wrestling during the overtime period. Furthermore,
                combining the results into a super-match format empowers coaches to respond to the current
                outcomes and decide which athletes they wish to field in subsequent periods. This enables the
                selection of athletes based on their specific skill sets they possess.</p>
            <p>The super-match structure, in which three different athletes may compete within one match to
                determine the team result, changes the structure from an individual component match structure to
                a team structure. This unique attribute further shifts the competition structure to be more
                team-centric in the tie-breaker for team advancement.</p>

                    missed something, but what if an athlete in the quarterfinals of the team tournament needs
                    to wrestle in the regional tournament to qualify for the individual tournament? They are
                    expected to travel and compete in a regional as well? (June 7, 2023)</li></h3>
                    <p>No, athletes will not compete the next day.</p>

                                        contests needed to meet the requirements outlined for conference qualification.</p>
                    
                                    <p>Additionally, the Big Ten conference dual schedule is currently completed prior to the
                                        postseason which would be when a conference would need to have determined their
                                        conference champion if they wished to have an automatic bid to the team championship.

                                    <p>All conferences have November, December, January, and February to hold competitions to
                                        determine their conference automatic bid. Conferences may set up their own conference
                                        scheduling as they would like. It is expected that conferences would award their
                                        automatic bid to their conference regular season champion as that would require little,
                                        if any, change to teams current schedules.</p>
                    
                                    <p>There is nothing in this framework that requires the Big Ten Conference to make any
                                        substantial changes to meet the requirements for the conference to earn an automatic
                                        bid.</p>

                                <p>Prior to producing the report, there was an extensive analysis of the proposals,
                                    hypotheses,
                                    and
                                    recommendations circulating within the wrestling community, including those put forth by
                                    the esteemed Blue
                                    Ribbon Task Force. Multiple options were thoroughly reviewed and evaluated, taking into
                                    consideration
                                    relevant
                                    research and modeling that could provide insights into these proposals.</p>
                    
                    
                                <p>This analysis identified deficiencies in the hypothesis that shifting the NCAA Wrestling
                                    Championships
                                    to April, or later, would enhance consumer demand and interest in the NCAA Wrestling
                                    Championships and/or
                                    regular season. While it is true April hosts fewer NCAA Championships compared to March,
                                    simply moving the
                                    championships to April (or later) does not guarantee an increase in consumption of NCAA
                                    Wrestling.</p>
                    
                                <p>In order to maintain the strong interest in the NCAA Individual Wrestling Championships
                                    within the expanded
                                    structure of a team and individual championship, it is crucial to ensure that the
                                    quality of the venue and
                                    the
                                    competition structure remains enjoyable for what this report identifies as sport
                                    loyalists who have been the
                                    core regular attendees of the Championship event for years.</p>
                    
                                <p>If the championships were moved to April (or even May), it would likely result in a
                                    decrease in the demand
                                    for
                                    bids to host the championship event, directly impacting the event's profitability.</p>
                    
                                <p>The NCAA Wrestling Championship requires high-quality arenas capable of accommodating
                                    15,500 spectators per
                                    session, equipped with LED video boards, ribbon boards, media production studios,
                                    professionally equipped
                                    video
                                    control rooms, green rooms, meeting rooms, as well as full-time staffing for all
                                    in-house production staff,
                                    located within a city with enough hotel rooms to accommodate the influx of attendees
                                    (National
                                    Collegiate Athletic Association, 2019a). Most of the venues
                                    capable of meeting these standards are professional sports arenas with full-time NBA
                                    and/or NHL tenants.</p>
                    
                                <p>The duration of the NCAA Individual Wrestling Championships requires the host venue to be
                                    allocated for
                                    nearly a
                                    full week (Monday to Sunday). Thus if the NCAA Wrestling Championships are moved to
                                    April, it will be nearly
                                    impossible for venues with professional tenants to bid on hosting the Championships as
                                    the event's dates are
                                    in
                                    direct competition with the NBA and NHL playoffs (National Basketball Association, 2023;
                                    National Hockey
                                    League, 2023). These venues must reserve these playoff dates for their
                                    full-time tenants, ensuring facility availability should their primary tenant(s) make
                                    the playoffs.</p>
                    
                                <p>This reduction in the number of prospective venues will significantly reduce the number
                                    of competitive bids
                                    received by the Association. Therefore, moving the Championships to April or May would
                                    likely result in
                                    cities
                                    like Des Moines (2013 host), Albany (2002), or Omaha (2010) winning the rights to host
                                    the Championships,
                                    after
                                    cities like Philadelphia (2011), New York (2016), Cleveland (2018), Detroit (2022), and
                                    Saint Louis (2021)
                                    decline to bid on the Championships.</p>
                    
                                <p>Not only would the net impact likely lead to a reduction in the number of possible
                                    attendees due to smaller
                                    venues in less desirable locales, but it would also increase expenses for flights and
                                    hotels for the
                                    association as well as fans adding to a
                                    decrease in overall local championship amenities.</p>
                    
                                <p>The impact of such a change is particularly concerning due to the NCAA Wrestling
                                    Committee recently reviewing
                                    increasing the minimum financial guarantee necessary for hosting the NCAA Individual
                                    Championships from $2.5
                                    Million to $3 Million (National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2023a). These higher
                                    financial guarantees
                                    may
                                    prove too burdensome for the remaining prospective host municipalities,
                                    resulting in a reduction in the financial guarantees for the championships overall.</p>
                    
                                <p>A reduction in financial guarantees would directly impact the Association's investment in
                                    the NCAA
                                    Wrestling Championship(s) and subsequently lead to a decline in the quality of the event
                                    for all
                                    stakeholders.</p>
                    
                                <p>While there has been considerable discussion about the NCAA Wrestling Championships
                                    competing with the NCAA
                                    Men's Basketball Championships for viewers, it's important to recognize that the
                                    consumption of
                                    intercollegiate
                                    sports is driven primarily as an entertainment and leisure activity. As a result,
                                    competition is not limited
                                    to
                                    NCAA Championships or or even sports in general. Competition may come from any
                                    alternative entertainment or
                                    leisure activity individuals find more preferable, in the moment, than consuming NCAA
                                    Championship
                                    Wrestling.</p>
                    
                                <p>This means that while moving the Wrestling Championships would avoid the competition with
                                    NCAA Men's
                                    Basketball
                                    Championships, new competition would arise from alternative sports programming such as
                                    the NBA playoffs, NHL
                                    playoffs, and MLB regular season. Additionally, the most significant competition is
                                    likely to come from
                                    outdoor
                                    activities, spring high school or youth sports, or simply nicer weather and longer days.
                                </p>
                    
                                <p>In March, the prime television-watching season comes to an end, and viewership declines
                                    significantly during
                                    the spring and summer months (Krantz-Kent, 2018). Research by Barnett et al. (1991) has
                                    shown that modeling
                                    based on three non-programing based variables, which includes seasonality, can model
                                    television viewership
                                    with 99% accuracy. This builds on previous research which was able to model highly
                                    accurate viewership predictions for primetime network television based on viewing habits
                                    and non-viewing activities without needing to factor in programing or demographics of
                                    the viewership (Gensch & Shaman, 1980). If the NCAA Wrestling Championships were moved
                                    from March to April,
                                    it would shift the
                                    event from a period when many people are watching televised sports to a time
                                    when fewer people
                                    intend to watch any television.</p>
                    
                    
                                <p>This change is due primarily to the transition in seasons, which leads to more sunshine
                                    (longer days) and
                                    increased average temperatures. As temperatures rise and days become longer, following
                                    the cold and dark
                                    winter,
                                    television viewership declines at a predictable and measurable rate (Eisinga, Franses, &
                                    Vergeer, 2011). The
                                    improved weather provides new opportunities for engaging in
                                    alternative entertainment activities that feel more novel following the winter months
                                    and are valued more
                                    highly
                                    than watching television at this time of the year.</p>
                    
                                <p>Moreover, people are not only less likely to watch television in April and May but also
                                    less likely to be
                                    aware
                                    of televised events. This is partly due to reduced consumption of television, which
                                    provides information on
                                    future programming, and would likely be exasperated within wrestling's consumers due to
                                    the lack of
                                    continuity
                                    of the various wrestling competition seasons.</p>
                    
                                <p>Aligning the intercollegiate wrestling season with the youth and high school seasons is
                                    crucial for fostering
                                    a
                                    culture of wrestling consumption. During this time of year, the wrestling community
                                    spends more time
                                    together,
                                    thinking about the sport, and engaging in natural discussions about the sport, including
                                    the programming and
                                    results of the NCAA Championships.</p>
                    
                                <p>Shifting the intercollegiate seasons and championships to a different time of year, when
                                    the majority of high
                                    school and wrestling stakeholders have moved on to other activities, would diminish the
                                    sport's connection
                                    with
                                    its target consumers (high school and youth wrestlers, coaches, and their parents). The
                                    sport specialization
                                    rate within wrestling (~30%) is lower than the typical high school sport specialization
                                    rate (Howard, 2016).

                                    at the high school level, where athletes are most likely to specialize compared to the
                                    youth level, there is
                                    a high probability that the
                                    target consumers will have moved on to other activities and will be spending time
                                    outside of the wrestling
                                    community.</p>
                    
                                <p>As an example, the Ohio High School Athletic Association's (OHSAA) state wrestling
                                    championships, which
                                    conclude

                                    Championships to April, every single high school State Championship will have been
                                    completed for at least a
                                    month, with nearly 50% of high school State Championships concluding over two months
                                    prior (Abbott, 2022).
                                </p>
                    
                                <p>Considering that the high school wrestling postseason often runs for a month and the
                                    majority of high school
                                    (and youth) athletes do not compete in state championships, most of the targeted
                                    prospective youth and high
                                    school wrestling consumers will have ended their wrestling season three months prior.
                                    Moving the
                                    Championships
                                    away from the high school competition season would reduce the influence that key
                                    wrestling stakeholders,
                                    such as
                                    wrestling coaches and state qualifier athletes, have on other prospective wrestling
                                    consumers.</p>
                    
                                <p>In April, the wrestling community would be less concentrated as the majority of those
                                    involved in high school
                                    and youth wrestling take time off from the sport and move on to other communities. One
                                    of the most common
                                    communities they transition to is spring sports, with Little League baseball being a
                                    prominent example,
                                    running
                                    from March to May (Coatess, 2023). Consequently, the social influence within the
                                    wrestling community, which
                                    can serve as a
                                    strong motivation for casual sports consumption, would be greatly diminished as the
                                    influence of the Little
                                    League baseball communities became stronger for these individuals.</p>
                    
                                <p>The high school athletes who move on to spring sports, such as baseball, would already be
                                    a month into their
                                    baseball games when the NCAA Championships are held. Wrestling wouldn't only be
                                    competing for attention but
                                    actually be in direct competition with actual scheduled athletic events for the
                                    prospective consumers.</p>
                    
                                <p>It's essential to note that the improved weather does not only result in a change to the
                                    athletic communities
                                    people may be within but also result in a change to their social behaviors (Essa et al.,
                                    1990). The
                                    transition in weather and longer days leads to a
                                    change
                                    in behaviors, resulting in reduced interest in watching television or attending indoor
                                    events (Eisinga,
                                    Franses, & Vergeer, 2011l Vachon, 1983).</p>
                    
                                <p>The likelihood of individuals being more engaged with the sport due to the college season
                                    no longer facing
                                    competition from the youth and high school season is not great. This is already evident
                                    within USA
                                    Wrestling's
                                    senior level competitions, which feature the biggest names in the sport. While these
                                    events may not face the
                                    competition often cited as a barrier for the consumption of the NCAA Wrestling
                                    Championships, consumption
                                    remains weak, with wrestling loyalists comprising the base.</p>
                    
                                <p>Consumers are going to be less likely to choose wrestling as an entertainment activity as
                                    the event will be
                                    taking place indoors at a time when consumers are eager to be able to enjoy outdoor
                                    activities.</p>
                    
                                <p>It is worth noting that the Big Ten Network's (BTN) support for shifting the wrestling
                                    programming should not
                                    be
                                    surprising. BTN has limited programing options available in the spring due, in large
                                    part, to the majority
                                    of
                                    the conference's spring inventory of athletic competitions being baseball and softball
                                    games (Big Ten,
                                    n.a.). These contests,
                                    which start six weeks prior to Major League Baseball's opening day (Major League
                                    Baseball, 2023), require
                                    the Big Ten's teams to travel
                                    to
                                    warmer climates for away games throughout February and March in order to be able to play
                                    games without snow on the ground. This results in the conference not being able to
                                    capture the
                                    media rights for
                                    these
                                    contests as not being the host (sponsoring) school.</p>
                    
                                <p>For instance, Michigan didn't play their first game in the north until their 15th game of
                                    the season,
                                    following
                                    trips to Arizona, California, and Texas (Michigan Athletics, 2023). Even after that
                                    single home game, they
                                    traveled back south for
                                    another
                                    four games in Georgia. Leaving only one out of the first twenty games of the season
                                    being available for the
                                    Big Ten Network to broadcast.</p>
                    
                                <p>As a result, the network is left with minimal programing options during the spring (Big
                                    Ten, n.a. -a).
                                    Shifting the wrestling
                                    schedule would help load balance the BTN's programing, providing more original content
                                    and reducing their
                                    reliance on reruns of previous broadcasts (Big Ten Network, 2023). However, this shift
                                    does not necessarily
                                    guarantee an improvement in
                                    the
                                    overall reach of wrestling for the Big Ten or other conferences.</p>
                    
                                <p>Though it should be noted, the recent addition of warm climate schools UCLA and USC to
                                    the Big Ten Conference
                                    will increase the available Big Ten controlled spring sport programing through expanded
                                    Women's Gymnastics,
                                    Baseball, and Softball, and Beach Volleyball programming for the early spring season
                                    (Uggetti, 2022). This
                                    programing would
                                    simply be new competition for wrestling programming on the BTN if wrestling were to
                                    shift the season to
                                    April or May.

                                <p>It is important to note that the location of the wrestling championships and postseason
                                    on the calendar, when
                                    properly aligned, can greatly benefit from the heightened interest in sports television
                                    consumption fueled
                                    by
                                    March Madness.</p>
                    
                                <p>Not every viewership slot in March is filled with NCAA Men's Basketball Championship
                                    programing. The NCAA
                                    Wrestling Championships being the same month of the Men's Basketball Championship can be
                                    a significant asset
                                    to
                                    wrestling with an expanded Championship structure that features the team championships
                                    during the week and
                                    between the March Madness basketball tournament. It is possible to align wrestling's
                                    championship schedule
                                    to

                                <p>Harold Hotelling's (1929) pioneering research on spatial competition and location theory
                                    has demonstrated
                                    the benefits of clustering competing firms, whereby competitors positioning themselves
                                    next to one another improves their ability to capture select customers.</p>
                    
                                <p>This phenomenon can be observed in car dealerships, mattress stores, gas stations,
                                    restaurants and many other industries, where
                                    firms in direct competition with each-other will cluster together (Joffe-Walt &
                                    Davidson, 2009).</p>
                    
                                <p>These same benefits apply to media consumption, where being positioned on select
                                    distribution networks and/or
                                    being positioned alongside high-demand programming can yield better performance for a
                                    media property (Malang et al., 2022; Ryu et
                                    al., 2019). The
                                    increasing success of the NCAA Women's Basketball Championships serves as a prime
                                    example (Weiner, 2023).
                                    The Women's
                                    basketball championships have benefited from being positioned alongside the Men's
                                    Championship in March,
                                    leading to
                                    greater consumption of the women's championship than would be experienced if the event
                                    was scheduled on its
                                    own in April.</p>
                    
                                <p>It's true that wrestling's currently scheduled individual championship date is not
                                    optimal. (See calendar
                                    below.) Currently, the championship sits in
                                    direct competition with the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship's busiest days of
                                    competition. Moving away
                                    from this saturated date on the calendar is

                                <p>In addition to the Wrestling Championships being better positioned as one of the limited
                                    number of live
                                    sporting events on each of the dates of the event, the Team Wrestling Championships will
                                    also be held on a
                                    date when there are no
                                    NCAA Men's Basketball games due to the postseason structure of men's basketball. The
                                    team championship finals will be held the day following the announcement of the Men's
                                    Basketball Championship field which means teams will be traveling to their postseason
                                    events. It is one of the few days of the year in which no men's college basketball games
                                    are played. This will be wrestling's championship date.</p>
                                <p>These changes position wrestling well to benefit from the increase in televised sports
                                    consumption produced
                                    by the cultural impact of March Madness.</p>
                                <p>As an example of the benefits of spatial proximity in driving sports programing
                                    viewership, we can look at the postseason college
                                    football schedule. As there are fewer games on each day, the post season continues
                                    to attract fans who
                                    have grown accustomed to watching Saturday sports through the fall. This scheduling
                                    proximity benefitted the 2022 Celebration
                                    Bowl, which drew 2.42 million viewers for the matchup between North Carolina Central
                                    University and
                                    Jackson State University (Showbuzzdaily, n.d.-a). These are programs which rarely
                                    attract
                                    rated viewership to their games.</p>
                    
                                <p>This game would not have drawn such strong
                                    viewership if it were positioned within a regular season week with many other games
                                    going on at the same
                                    time. For comparison, in week nine of the college football season, the 7th most watched
                                    game of the week was
                                    Notre Dame
                                    vs Syracuse with 2.34 million viewers (SportsMediaWatch, n.d. -a). The matchup with
                                    North Carolina Central and Jackson State outdrew this matchup by being scheduled at a
                                    time when consumption is high but programing is low. The same structure which the
                                    Cucumber Report is proposing for wrestling.</p>
                    
                                <p>In fact, moving games to April, where there is less competition, did not benefit the 2020
                                    FCS Division I Football Championships.
                                    Following the Covid-19 impacted fall 2020 football season, with the support of the
                                    television networks looking to bolster spring programing, the FCS football championship
                                    was rescheduled to the spring of 2021 when there was significantly less sports
                                    programming to compete for viewership. However, the spring Championship was only viewed
                                    by 905,000 people (Herder, 2021). A significant decline from the 2.7 million viewers
                                    from the previous year's FCS Championship, despite the previous year's championship
                                    facing competition from the NFL playoffs and college basketball.</p>
                    
                                <p>While the significance of the game did not change, nor did the popularity of the sport,
                                    what changed was the
                                    seasonal viewership of television and the seasonal preference of consumers. Fall is
                                    largely viewed by many
                                    consumers as football season. They associate watching football with the season and the
                                    holidays serving as
                                    the time for championships. This all changed with the shifting of the FCS Division I
                                    football Championship
                                    to the spring season, and the consumers did not respond well. While shifting the
                                    championship to the spring provided more football at a time of year that football fans
                                    don't typically get to watch football. Consumers did not respond. And the same is likely
                                    true for wrestling's identity within the winter season.</p>
                    
                                <p>For this reason, wrestling shifting to the spring is likely to experience a decline in
                                    engagement with its regular season. While there is competition with high school and
                                    youth competitors' own seasons, which can limit their ability to attend collegiate
                                    competitions, as previously mentioned, it is precisely because they are in-season and
                                    focused on the sport at that moment within the calendar year that there is interest in
                                    attending collegiate competitions in the first place. Creating a high-quality
                                    championship for wrestling is important, but as Seth Duckworth (2023) has noted, the
                                    financial success of the NCAA Wrestling Championship doesn't benefit individual
                                    programs. It is important that the structures utilized within the sport don't simply
                                    continue to focus on the Championships but work to be a holistic structure that benefits
                                    programs of disparate levels of investment and performance.</p>
                    
                                <p>Wrestling needs to be able to measure the impact of any changes made. Simply making
                                    changes without
                                    performing a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the changes prevents the
                                    fine-tuning of the
                                    structure.</p>
                    
                                <p>By not making a significant shift to the season, the impact on consumption and engagement
                                    for the new
                                    structure with a separate team and individual championship can be measured. This is
                                    important for any
                                    significant change.</p>
                    
                                <p>While the Blue Ribbon Task Force and this author have independently come to the same
                                    position regarding a
                                    team dual championship, the proposed shift in the season, proposed by the Blue Ribbon
                                    Task Force, introduces
                                    unnecessary risk. It is vital that there be an evaluation and consideration period for
                                    any implemented
                                    structure. The adoption of the proposal herein should be done for a four-year period,
                                    during which there
                                    will be a review of the structure to decide if the implementation shall persist or if
                                    the stakeholders wish
                                    to revert to the previous structure.</p>
                    
                                <p>When making a change in the season structure at the same time as the competition
                                    structure, you introduce
                                    many new variables that can impact the metrics which make it impossible to assess
                                    performance. Does
                                    viewership increase or
                                    decline due to the new format or due to the season shift? Does the season shift impact
                                    student-athletes
                                    positively or negatively, or should that be attributed to the change in the competition
                                    structure?</p>
                    
                                <p>The above-stated considerations were among those that led to the Cucumber Report
                                    producing an alternative
                                    conclusion upon reviewing the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Task Force.</p>

                2023)</li></h3>
                <p>Yes. That is correct. No member of any media company was involved with the creation of
                    the report or influenced the report in any manner. There are no independent media member
                    or journalists involved with the Cucumber Report as well.

            <a href="#QuestionList">Back to Questions</a><li><h3 id="Q12">In terms of tie-breaker rules, in the event that the final match of the dual has the slimmest
                margin of victory (1 point) and would therefore be the first tie-breaker match necessary in the
                next section. Would this not interfere with the rest time necessary to compete this match and by
                wording in the report, does this then ensure that the weights that were most closely contested
                would then not have the same athletes competing? Further, would this mean that "rovers"
                would need to compete at the given weight? In the event that one or both teams are not able to
                field an athlete due to rest time restrictions, what would the result be? (August 29, 2023)</li></h3>
                <p>The participation of an athlete in a team tie-breaker doesn't count as a separate match as the
                    result from the team tie-breaker will not reported on the individual athlete's Season Record
                    Form. Therefore, the stipulated rest time between matches doesn't apply to the team tie-breaker
                    situation. The team tie-breaker is essentially a continuation of the ongoing dual meet,
                    permitting athletes to compete.</p>

                <p>Engaging in a team tie-breaker allows athletes to extend their wrestling capacity without the
                    requirement of immediate rest, much like how an individual match's over-time extends their
                    ability to compete without a mandatory rest period.</p>

                <p>However, if an athlete intends to participate in a second team tie-breaker, the rest time
                    requirement comes into effect. For example, let's say the concluding match of the dual meet
                    involves the 125 weight division and also serves as the first tie-breaker. If a 125-weight
                    athlete competes in the dual meet's 125 tie-breaker, the athlete would need to observe the
                    mandated
                    rest period from the time of the tie-breaker ended before being eligible for another
                    tie-breaker.

                <p>This means that if the second tie-breaker was the 133 division, the 125 athlete could not bump up
                    and compete in it because the athlete would not have the rest needed. But if the 133 division
                    was tie-breaker eight, then the 125 athlete may be able bump up to the 133 tie-breaker, should
                    enough rest time have passed.</p>

                <p>Rovers are not necessary for a program to compete in a dual or a tie-breaker. The Rovers simply
                    provide additional options to a team.</p>
                    
            <a href="#QuestionList">Back to Questions</a><li><h3 id="Q13">Why provide visiting teams with an Extra Pound Allowance on dates where there is only a single team
                competition? (September 8, 2023)</li></h3>
                <p>The question of why visiting teams should be granted an extra pound allowance is a reasonable
                    one.
                    It's important to note that there are already existing provisions within the NCAA wrestling
                    rules
                    that allow for weight allowances in certain circumstances (Examples: Rule 9, Section 3, Article
                    2;
                    Rule 9, Section 4, Article 5). The proposed change to provide a weight allowance for visiting
                    teams
                    is not a radical departure from established practice. In fact, the concept of weight allowances
                    is
                    not entirely new, as individual athletes are already eligible for allowances even if they did
                    not
                    compete on the previous day (Rule 9, Section 3, Article 2). And this rule would only apply to
                    the
                    athletes who have already weighed-in for the weight division previously and are permitted to
                    make
                    the weight without the allowance in their weight loss plan to ensure that the health standards
                    within the sport are maintained and this change is not used as a mechanism to increase weight
                    loss
                    practices.</p>

                <p>NCAA wrestling encompasses a diverse range of programs, each with its unique interests and
                    concerns.
                    This proposed change aims to address the specific challenges faced by programs that lack
                    geographical proximity to other Division I institutions, whether within or outside their
                    conference.
                    Additionally, it considers the constraints imposed by class schedules and the financial
                    resources
                    available for travel.</p>

                <p>While some programs may not view travel as a significant barrier, especially those situated in
                    regions with many Division I programs or with substantial resources to facilitate air travel and
                    extended lodging stays, there are numerous programs that hesitate to participate in team dual
                    competitions away from home. Their hesitation often stems from concerns about the added stress
                    their
                    athletes will experience while managing weight during travel, particularly across different time
                    zones, which can result in jet lag and hinder performance.</p>

                <p>This proposed change aims to alleviate some of the added stress associated with travel. It
                    acknowledges that many programs would like to engage in more team competitions in various
                    locations
                    but are deterred by the long bus journeys, lodging costs, and potential adverse effects on their
                    athletes' performance, both on and off the mat.</p>

                <p>By implementing this small change, we can foster a more inclusive and competitive wrestling
                    environment. Teams that travel to disparate locations will no longer face as significant an
                    obstacle
                    when it comes to weight management, making it easier for them to participate in team
                    competitions
                    and further enrich the sport of wrestling as well as the experiences of the student-athletes
                    within
                    their programs.</p>

                <p>There is now an incentive for programs looking to offer a financial guarantee to bring in an
                    opponent to offer that guarantee to a program from outside of their region as they will also be
                    offering a weight allowance to their opponent.</p>

                <p>Moreover, implementing an extra pound allowance for visiting teams may also stimulate the
                    creation
                    of long-term series between institutions. With the alternating weight allowance benefiting each
                    team
                    in different years, it creates a natural incentive for teams to engage in a series of matches
                    that
                    span multiple seasons. This dynamic encourages teams to build competitive rivalries and seek
                    opportunities to return the advantage in future years. These long-term series not only enhance
                    the
                    excitement and tradition of college wrestling but also contribute to a more balanced and
                    competitive
                    landscape, where the playing field is leveled over time. In this way, the weight allowance
                    policy
                    fosters not only fairness but also the growth and sustainability of collegiate wrestling.</p>

                <p>It is important to note that this weight allowance does not apply to neutral site competitions or
                    to dates of competition where there are multiple team or individual competitions being held.</p>

            <a href="#QuestionList">Back to Questions</a><li><h3 id="Q14">Why Do Coaches Select the Match Order? (September 8, 2023)</li></h3>
            <p>The changes outlined and proposed within this report represent a significant shift in the team
                dynamic within the sport. Consequently, team competitions take on greater significance
                throughout the season. With this change, the team dynamic and the coaches' ability to maximize
                the competition for their student-athletes become paramount, introducing a strategic dimension
                to the matches.</p>

            <p>Individual matches within the team competition now carry an additional weight in the team's
                post-season qualification, leading athletes to feel a greater sense of responsibility for their
                program and the need to respond to the conditions of the team competition, as well as their
                individual opponent.</p>

            <p>As a result, coaches may wish to position certain athletes earlier or later in a match based on
                their ability to handle this added level of stress or their capacity to elevate their
                performance when needed, considering the team score.</p>

            <p>Coaches possess an in-depth understanding of their team's strengths and weaknesses, as well as
                those of their opponents. This knowledge allows them to tailor the match order to exploit
                favorable matchups or mitigate disadvantages effectively.</p>

            <p>Moreover, giving coaches the authority to determine the match order opens up opportunities for
                additional athletes to earn their place in the lineup. Coaches might want to introduce backup
                student-athletes into the team competition to gain experience and recognize their progress in
                the practice room. However, they might be unable to do so if the weight class is scheduled early
                in the competition, with uncertainty about the team result later in the contest.</p>

            <p>This flexibility allows coaches to utilize rovers, altering their lineups on-the-fly to better
                serve their team's needs. This could involve moving a star athlete up a weight class in pursuit
                of a different net outcome to make up team points or resting athletes when the team result is no
                longer in doubt.</p>

            <p>This dynamic introduces a new dimension to coaching, enabling coaches to exercise creativity in
                decision-making to influence the ebb and flow of team competitions in their favor, while
                opposing programs strive to do the same.</p>

            <p>The outcome of this strategic coaching battle is likely to produce a sequence of matches that is
                more captivating for fans watching the competition than a fixed progression based solely on
                weight classification.</p>

            <p>That is up to the member institutions.  The process for enacting reform within the NCAA is well defined and depends on the will of the Association's membership.  Continuing to build out the coalition of institutions for enacting reforms based on the Cucumber Report is a vital step in the imlementation process. </p>

            <a href="#QuestionList">Back to Questions</a><li><h3 id="Q23">Why is the team championship first? The Individual Tournament needs to be held first
                with the team championship being second. Otherwise you risk harming the individual
                tournament which is what everyone values the most. (February 17, 2024)</li></h3>
                <p>The historical precedence of the individual NCAA wrestling championship as the
                    culminating event of the season is well understood and deeply ingrained in the wrestling
                    community.  Student-athletes have long aspired to attain individual titles as the pinnacle of their
                    collegiate careers, as the NCAA's individual wrestling championships predate the NCAA holding a team championship (<cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="The History of Collegiate Wrestling: A Century of Wrestling Excellence.">Hammond, 2006;</cite> <cite title="Wrestling Championship History and Records.">National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d. -j</cite>). </p>

                <p>Addressing the concern about the sequence of championship events, it's essential to understand the rationale behind prioritizing the team championship first.  One key rationale supporting the prioritization of the team championship being contested first lies in its role as the program's focal point. This shift prompts athletes to concentrate on team objectives until individual competition becomes their sole focus. This balance is crucial for reshaping how collegiate wrestling competitions work, potentially easing the burden on coaches. With these changes, coaches may find it less challenging to navigate between team interests and individual aspirations, allowing them to better prioritize both the team's goals and the individual goals of each student-athlete on their roster throughout the season.</p>


                <p>Emphasizing the team championship initially fosters camaraderie and team spirit among athletes, coaches, and fans <cite title="Casual spectators and die-hard fans' reactions to their team defeat: A look at the role of territorial identification in elite French rugby.">(Bernache, Laurin, & Bodet, 2012)</cite>. It enables wrestlers to compete cohesively, bolstering
                    pride and unity within their respective teams, thereby maximizing institutional benefits
                    for the institutions investing in the sponsorship of the sport of wrestling <cite title="The Positive Social and Self Concept Consequences of Sports Team Identification.">(Branscombe & Wann, 1991)</cite>.</p>


                <p>Team dual meet competitions tend to draw more spectators and generate greater excitement than individual tournaments, as evident by the events throughout the regular season. By spotlighting the team championship first, NCAA wrestling can capitalize on this heightened interest to draw in more wrestling enthusiasts to the sport through the team championship, garnering increased attention for the sport as a whole in a format that is easily understood by those not familiar with the field of collegiate athletes. This will allow spectators of the team championship to be introduced to the elite athletes within the team competition, which will increase their interest in continuing to follow those athletes within the subsequent individual championships <cite
                        title="Superstars and disloyal football fans: factors influencing attraction to competition">(Hoegele, Schmidt & Torgler, 2014b)</cite>.</p>

                <p>Collegiate athletes have long prioritized their personal interests, necessitating a structural balance between team and personal goals within the sport of wrestling. It's imperative
                    for athletes to prioritize the interests of the institutions sponsoring their
                    opportunities, which helps to safeguard the continued investment into the sport of
                    wrestling at the sponsoring institutions <cite
                    title="Factors Contributing to the Elimination of NCAA Division I Intercollegiate Wrestling Programs">(Fair, 2017)</cite>.</p>

                    

                <p>Due to the sport's history and culture, it's anticipated that wrestling loyalists will
                    continue to prioritize the individual championship when choosing to attend only one
                    championship event. Hence, maintaining the individual championship as the season's
                    pinnacle event is essential, as it amplifies the championship narrative, with occasional
                    rematches becoming more personal as the individual accolades hinge on the results,
                    adding to its allure.</p>

                <p>Holding the team championships after the individual championships would likely result in some student-athletes (starters and non-starters) electing to opt-out of competing in a team championship after they have exhausted their individual championship opportunities.  This phenomenon is already observed within other NCAA sports (<cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Arkansas star Daniel Gafford, projected first-round pick, skipping NIT to prepare for NBA Draft">Boone, 2019</cite>; <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Parents of North Carolina men's basketball players say NIT fate was left up to the team">Peter, 2022</cite>; <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Who is opting out of the major bowl games? Some of college football's biggest names.">Myerberg, 2023</cite>). This would likely be exacerbated within an Olympic year with athletes opting out of the team competition to train for the Olympics, potentially diminishing the significance of the collegiate championships.</p>

                <p>When the team championship is held first, the interest of the athlete complements and
                    supports the interest of the sponsoring institution, which has made the investment into
                    the sport and funded the opportunities for the athletes within their program. All of the
                    individual component matches not only serve the interest of the institution in their
                    quest for institutional accolades but also serve the individual athletes in positioning themselves for
                    opportunities to earn individual accolades. The championship event which recognizes the accomplishments of the
                    institution funding the student-athlete opportunities is prioritized first-increasing
                    the benefits to the institution.</p>

                <p>The structure proposed within the Cucumber Report balances not only the interests of an
                    institution and its student-athletes but also the student-athletes and institutions throughout the sport's membership with various levels of performance. This is because the
                    length of the postseason is not dramatically different for programs or individuals based on the performance of team.</p>

                <p>The dual-track postseason proposed, whereby teams not competing within the team championship may
                    still compete for qualification of their athletes for the individual championship,
                    ensures there are no extended breaks for programs within the season, nor is the season
                    extended for a select number of programs based on their team's success.</p>

                <p>This is significant, as it not only aligns with the preference of many coaches and student-athletes to avoid extending the season but also enhances the chances of approval within the NCAA's committee structure. The collegiate framework and NCAA policies dictate that any proposed team championship structures following the individual championships are unlikely to gain committee approval.</p>

                <p>This is primarily due to the length of the season and provisions for individual
                    competition outlined in the NCAA manual <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="17.28.1 (Wrestling) Length of Playing Season.">(17.28.1)</cite>. The NCAA competition season is well-defined and
                    limited in length by program declared schedules <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="17.28.5 Number of Dates of Competition.">(17.28.5)</cite>. Athletes may participate in postseason training
                    and competition only upon qualifying for a championship event, without the dates counting against the team's season length <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="17.1.9 General Regulations for Computing Playing Seasons.">(17.1.9)</cite>. Currently, only
                    individual athletes qualifying for the NCAA championships continue postseason training,
                    with necessary training partners also permitted to continue. All other team members are
                    released from training and transition into the offseason, by NCAA policy <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="17.1.9.c NCAA Championships Participation in Individual Sports.">(17.1.9.c)</cite>.</p>

                <p>Introducing a team championship at a later date would extend the season for entire
                    rosters, contingent on the possibility of qualification for the team championships.</p>

                <p>This extension could create false hope for many programs and athletes, potentially
                    leading to unwarranted training for a championship invitation that may never
                    materialize. Additionally, it could result in significant disparities in team training,
                    with some teams enduring a prolonged season, including training through both the
                    individual and team championships while other teams would have a significantly shorter
                    season.</p>

                <p>Even individual athletes in the starting lineup for a team that qualified for the team
                    championships may not be guaranteed participation in the team competition after extended
                    training. Since team outcomes are determined once the team result is decided, not all
                    weight classes may be required to determine the team outcome. Scheduling the team
                    competition second would likely lead to instances where athletes who did not qualify for
                    the individual championship are required to train for an additional month, or more
                    (depending on the proposal), for a match that never occurs.</p>

                <p>Given the sport's expressed desire for reduced training, such a proposal would face
                    resistance from coaches and athletes during the vetting process and never gain traction.
                    From a policy perspective, the extensive additional timeline for full rosters to remain
                    engaged in training would likely fail administrative committee review within the NCAA's
                    vetting process as well.</p>

                <p>There will inevitably be athletes who train during the postseason. The current policy,
                    restricting postseason training to those athletes and teams included in postseason
                    events, is deemed the most appropriate and will remain unchanged within the framework
                    proposed within the Cucumber Report.</p>

                <p>Prioritizing the team championship first in the sequence of events allows teams
                    qualifying for the championship to maintain consistent training timelines alongside
                    programs focusing on supplemental qualifiers for their individual athletes. This
                    standardizes season length and competition frameworks for all programs, regardless of
                    team performance throughout the season.</p>

                <p>Only the athletes qualifying for the individual championship and opting to pursue
                    individual honors will have an extended training cycle, distinguishing them from other
                    team members. This is the current process and adheres to the NCAA standards and policy.
                </p>
                <p>While many different structures and proposals were explored, the structure proposed within the Cucumber Report best serves the various interests necessary for implementing change while also ensuring the long-term success of the championship(s) within the proposed structure.</p>
