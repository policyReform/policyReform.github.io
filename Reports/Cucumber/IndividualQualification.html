        <h1>IV. NCAA Wrestling Championships: Weight Class Championships</h1>
        <p>
        <p>The event where individual athletes compete to be crowned NCAA Division-I Wrestling National Champions for a
            weight
            class is to be called the NCAA Wrestling Championships to signify that there are plural champions to be
            crowned by
            virtue of the results during the event <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="2021-22 NCAA Division-I Manual,  31.02.2.2 Individual Championships, Championships Classification and Terminology">(31.02.2.2)</cite>.
            The following information will detail the qualification methods available for athletes to qualify for the
            NCAA
            Wrestling Championships. The administration of the event will remain unchanged.</p>

        <div id="issues" class="trackIt"></div>
        <h3>A. Current Qualification System Issues</h3>

        <p>The current system of allocating qualification bids to conferences
            based on the number of national qualifier-worthy athletes participating in the conference qualifier is a
            significant improvement over the previous
            system based on the historic success of the conference <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                data-bs-placement="top" title="Wrestling committee recommends allocation plan.">(Johnson, 2008)</cite>.
            However, the current system still has significant flaws. Wrestling's unique qualification structure has
            caused significant questions about the sport's integrity <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                data-bs-placement="top"
                title="Report of the NCAA Division I Wrestling Committee February 22, 2022, Videoconference">(National
                Collegiate
                Athletic Association, 2022o)</cite>. </p>




        <p>Despite the change in qualification process, national qualification-worthy athletes are still not guaranteed
            qualification to the
            NCAA (Individual) Wrestling Championships based on their regular season performance <cite
                data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="OSU likes new format.">(McLaughlin,
                2009)</cite>. This is a result of the
            lack of at-large qualification slots built into the system. Since the new system was adopted in 2009, an
            average of only three slots have been allocated for at-large bids within each weight classification each
            year. Only a few athletes are assured they will earn qualification based on their season's body of work.
            Even a top-five ranked athlete by the NCAA Championship's own selection criteria has no assurance that they
            will be awarded an at-large bid if they do not perform well at their qualification tournament. Despite a
            record of success throughout the season, there are only a very limited number of athletes that can be
            awarded at-large bids <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="Top 5 NCAA Performances By At-Large Selections.">(Spey, 2017)</cite>.</p>

        <p>For most athletes, the path to qualification depends solely on their performance at their qualifying
            tournament, requiring athletes to peak at the right time, regardless of regular season performance <cite
                data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="Big 12 Coaches Excited About Qualifying Format Cyclones Favored to Win">(Sesker, 2009)</cite>.
            While they are conference championships in name, in
            practice, these qualifying tournaments more closely resemble the NCAA's regional
            qualification model where placement determines qualification to the National Championships. However, under
            this system, there is added complexity and uncertainty
            regarding the benchmark that an athlete must achieve for qualification. The number of pre-allocated bids is
            dynamically calculated throughout the season which creates a moving target that persists even through the
            first round of competition at the qualifier (depending on if each pre-allocated athlete at the
            qualifier takes the mat to compete).</p>


        <p>In wrestling, athletes do not compete against the field as they would in a cross country race with 300
            athletes running at once. Nor do athletes compete against a field to compare their performance against a
            clock or a score like athletes in track, diving, golf, or gymnastics. Qualification tournaments in wrestling
            create a unique path to qualification for each athlete based on the unique matchups they are presented with.
            This system can create drastically different levels of difficulty within the same qualifying tournament
            depending on where an athlete is placed within the bracket.</p>



        <p>Coaches know that an individual matchup can play an outsized role in their athlete's ability to qualify for
            the NCAA Championships. And due to the parity within the sport as well as the method in which team standings
            are calculated at the NCAA Championships, this can have a significant impact on the team's postseason
            success.</p>
        <p>At the last three NCAA Championships, those since the NCAA adopted a policy of seeding all athletes, 46% of
            athletes seeded 25th or worse have won at least one match at the NCAA Championships. Simply getting your
            athletes into the field, even without a favorable seed, provides a program with a coin toss chance of
            scoring points in the team race.</p>

        <p>This incentivizes many coaches to work to minimize the quality of the opposition in an athlete's path through
            their qualifying tournament. It is this system that creates incentives that lead to questions of integrity
            within the sport.</p>

        <p>Overall, the current qualification system for wrestling has significant flaws that hinder the sport and raise
            questions about its integrity. There is a need for reform to create a system that more fairly allocates bids
            to ensure qualified athletes are guaranteed a place in the NCAA Championship based on their season's body of
            work.

        <h3 id="process">B. New Qualification Process</h3>

        <p>A new qualification process is created that better fits into the new holistic approach for the season while
            still leveraging many of the current performance metrics used within the current system.</p>
        <p>The following section will detail the qualification for athletes to the
            NCAA
            Wrestling Championships within the restructured framework.</p>

        <div id="directQualification" class="trackIt"></div>
        <h3>1. Direct Qualification</h3>
        <ul>
            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>Direct Qualification is a method by which a wrestler earns a bid to the NCAA Wrestling Championships by
                virtue of
                their regular season performance and in representing their team during the season.</p>

            <p>The NCAA Wrestling Committee will allocate a maximum of 20 direct qualifiers per weight class.</p>
            <h5>Eligibility</h5>
            <p>To be eligible for consideration to be a Direct Qualifier, a wrestler must have met the Team
                Representation standard for the season. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Team Representation</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>An athlete must have competed in a minimum of 45% of the total team competitions at a scored
                        weight
                        during the
                        season at the time of consideration for qualification.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A team competition is defined by Wrestling Rule 3.5.a.
                            (Example: Dual Meet)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>A scored weight is when the results for the weight were factored into the team score. Note:
                        Extra
                        matches/Exhibition
                        Matches do not count as scored matches.</li>
                    <li>There is no weight class requirement to meet the Team Representation standard. A wrestler may
                        qualify
                        at a
                        different weight than they represented the team.</li>
                    <li>Team competitions do not need to be against NCAA Division-I members to meet the Team
                        Representation
                        standard
                        but must be countable contests per NCAA bylaws.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h5>Process</h5>
            <p>All wrestlers who meet the Team Representation standard and are ranked in either the Coaches Ranking (CR)
                or
                the
                Ranking Percentage Index (RPI) Ranking will be considered for Direct Qualification. <i>Note: To
                    be included in either ranking an athlete must be designated by weight class on the NCAA Division I
                    Starters page within TrackWrestling.</i></p>
            <p>There is a predetermined sliding scale of three thresholds that move in unison, by round, to determine
                the
                cut
                line
                for the Direct Qualifiers in each weight class.</p>
            <p>A wrestler must meet two of the three standards in a round to become a Direct Qualifier.</p>
            <p>If a round would produce over twenty (20) direct qualifiers, then that round is not completed and none of
                the
                wrestlers in that round will become Direct Qualifiers. This will produce fewer than twenty Direct
                Qualifiers for
                the weight.</p>
            <p>Any of the top-25 athletes in the sliding scale by round, will be moved to the at-large consideration
                automatically.</p>
            <p>Should a round produce more than twenty wrestlers, then all those wrestlers will move to at-large
                consideration.
            </p>

            <p>Sliding scale metrics:</p>
            <ul>

            <p><i>Note: An athlete does
                    not need 15 matches to earn direct qualification. If the athlete meets the thresholds for team

                    winning percentage, and coaches rank they may be allocated a direct qualification.</i> </p>
            <h5>Dates and Schedules</h5>
            <p>The release of Direct Qualifiers will be Wednesday, February 25, 2025.</p>


            <h5>Replacements and Withdrawals</h5>
            <p>An athlete that has earned a Direct Qualification bid may be replaced, at the school's discretion,
                provided
                the
                replacement athlete meets all the following criteria at the time the replacement is requested: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Has met the Team Representation standard defined in the direct qualification process as of the date
                    of
                    the
                    replacement request.</li>
                <li>Replacement athlete has met a minimum of two out of the three Replacement Standard Minimums from the
                    metrics in
                    the final round of direct qualification.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note: In order to have a Coaches Rank, the replacement athlete will need to be updated in the
                        Track
                        Wrestling
                        Designated Starter page at the weight prior to coaches rankings being submitted. If this change
                        has
                        not been
                        made and a replacement request is submitted, an athlete will only be evaluated using the Ranking
                        Percentage
                        Index Rank and Winning Percentage. In such a case, the athlete must meet both
                        standards.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Replacement request is submitted prior to the day of seeding for the NCAA Wrestling Championships.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the replacement athlete has not met the Replacement Standard Minimums, but meets the other criteria,
                then
                the
                direct qualifier will be allocated to the at-large pool and the replacement athlete will be eligible for
                supplemental or at-large qualification if they would have been eligible for either in the absence of the
                teammate being declared the starter.</p>
            <p>If the replacement athlete request for an athlete eligible for supplemental qualification is submitted
                after
                the
                start of the supplemental qualifier the team is assigned to then the athlete will not be eligible for
                consideration
                for a bid and the bid will be allocated to the at-large pool.</p>

            <h5>Benefits, Direct Qualification</h5>

            <p>This system provides direct rewards to athletes based on their season performance and contributions to their team, fostering alignment between individual and team interests and creating a more harmonious structure for wrestling. To earn recognition as a starter on the TrackWrestling Starters Page, athletes are required to participate in a minimum number of team competitions. This requirement addresses the principal-agent problem often found in individual sports, where team competitions play a pivotal role <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="Tournament performance and “Agency” problems: An empirical investigation of “March madness”.">(McClure
                    & Spector, 1997)</cite>. This change balances the team interest by
                ensuring athletes represent their team in competition and contribute to the team's success
                to earn individual qualification.</p>

            <p>The competition threshold is intentionally set low to accommodate program flexibility in using various lineups during the season. Athletes are only required to participate in a minority of team competitions, which ensures that they can miss time due to injury or to allow other athletes a chance to compete without affecting the team representation provision.</p>

            <p>High-performing athletes who consistently meet the standards for qualification will be directly included
                in the individual championship field based on their season's performance. This is a widely adopted
                method of qualification in NCAA individual sports.</p>

            <p>Under this system, athletes are no longer required to defend their bid to the championship against other
                athletes who may not have performed consistently throughout the season. This benefit is not only
                extended to the identified starter at the time of selection, but also to any subsequent replacement
                athlete if the original qualifier is unable to compete at the championships and another athlete within
                the program meets the standards for qualification.</p>

            <p>Introducing a direct qualification system will relieve programs of a significant financial burden. This change means that programs will no longer be required to fund athletes' travel to qualifiers when these athletes have already met the qualifications necessary for entry into the NCAA Championships.</p>
            <p>While this report acknowledges the shortcomings of the metrics used in wrestling's
                current pre-allocation process, as identified in the study published by <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    data-bs-placement="top" title="Ranking and prediction of collegiate wrestling.">Bigsby & Ohlmann
                    (2016)</cite> in the <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 1-19, 2017">Journal of Sports Analytics</cite>, the established metrics,
                and criteria for individual qualification
                will continue to be used in the direct qualifier process to ensure a smooth transition to the new
                process. The top athletes
                under the current pre-allocation system will remain the top athletes in the direct qualifier process
                under the new system, as the same consideration process is being utilized.</p>

        <h3>2. Supplemental Qualification (Regional Events)</h3>


        <ul>
            <h5>About</h5>

            <p>Supplemental Qualification is a process where a wrestler may earn a bid to the NCAA Wrestling
                Championships by
                virtue of their placement in a two-day National Qualifying Event.</p>

            <p>Teams are assigned to a region prior to the start of each season based on geographic location. The
                regions
                will be
                equally divided with any imbalance in the number of teams in a region being decided based on geography
                so that the region covering the most geographic area will have the fewest teams.
            </p>
            <p>There will be one regional event held for each of the following regions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>North</li>
                <li>South</li>
                <li>West</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Regional events will be held at predetermined locations that are secured based on competitive bids to
                host.
                As is the case with the current qualifying system, individual programs are responsible for the cost of
                their athletes and staff to travel and compete at regional events.
            </p>


            <h5>Dates and Schedule</h5>

            <p>2025 Regional events may be held on either of the two possible dates.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Friday March 6, 2025 to Saturday March 7, 2025</li>
                <li>Saturday March 7, 2025 to Sunday March 8, 2025</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>If a school has a written policy preventing competition on Sundays the team will be assigned to a region
                competing on the Friday to Saturday schedule. Note: A minimum of one regional must compete on the Friday
                to
                Saturday schedule each year.</p>
            <p>The schedule for each day of competition at a regional event is to be established so that competition for
                the
                day
                will end a minimum of two hours prior to the scheduled start time of any NCAA Wrestling Championship
                competition on the same date.
            </p>

            <h5 id="supElig">Eligibility</h5>
            <p>To be eligible to compete in the supplemental qualification process a wrestler must meet all of
                the
                following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is competing in the designated weight class on the NCAA Division-I starters page in TrackWrestling.
                </li>

                <li>Has met the Team Representation standard defined in the Direct Qualification process as of the date
                    of
                    the
                    competition.</li>
                <li>Has not earned Direct Qualification.</li>
                <li>Not a member of a team represented in the quarter-finals of the NCAA Wrestling Championship.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Seeding</h5>
            <p>An updated set of Coaches Rank, RPI, and Winning Percentage will be provided for each athlete.</p>
            <p>A tiered system will be used to group athletes for seeding purposes at regional events. Each athlete will
                be
                placed
                into one of the three following tiers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tier I</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any athlete earning at-large consideration from the Direct Qualification process.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Tier II</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any athlete with a .700 or better Winning Percentage</li>
                    <li>Any athlete represented on the Coaches Rankings</li>
                    <li>Any athlete represented on the Ranking Percentage Index Ranking</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Tier III</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>All remaining athletes</li>
                </ul>

            </ul>
            <p>Seeds will not be declared and seed numbers will not be listed on the brackets. The process of seeding
                is the act of
                separating
                athletes within the bracket based on tiers. </p>
            <p>Athletes in Tier I will be randomly drawn and placed onto the top seed lines. Next Tier II athletes will
                be
                randomly drawn into the bracket on the remaining seed lines. Tier three athletes will then fill out the
                remaining
                seed lines of the bracket.</p>
            <p>This process will ensure that athletes are separated based on standards established within the
                qualification
                process.</p>

            <h5>Benefits, Supplemental Qualification</h5>


            <p>The current process for selecting pre-allocations for the NCAA Championships is susceptible to
                controversy, especially when choosing athletes who are "on the bubble." As the selection process moves
                further away from the top athletes, this issue becomes increasingly prevalent. However, the supplemental
                qualifier process offers a solution to this problem by addressing both the unequal qualification
                opportunities for athletes from different conferences and the challenge of selecting "bubble" athletes.
                This process allows non-qualifying athletes from the regular season to compete against each other for a
                chance to earn a bid.</p>
            <p>With the supplemental qualifier, imbalanced qualifiers are no longer an issue, and the practice of
                stealing pre-qualified athlete bids is eliminated. Athletes who have earned a bid through their
                successful season keep their bids.</p>

            <p>The supplemental qualifier offers a opportunity for athletes from programs no longer competing for the
                NCAA (Team) Championship to secure qualification to the individual championship.</p>
            <p>The supplemental qualifiers are the only events in which an athlete can secure qualification to the NCAA
                Championships based on a single event performance. All other qualification methods will consult the full
                season's body of work. This ensures that the primary focus of qualification remains based on season
                performance while still offering a last-chance pathway to determined athletes from the programs not
                competing for an NCAA (team) Championship.</p>
            <p>This process is in line with the regional and direct qualification processes used by many NCAA individual
                sports. The allocation of bids is spread out regionally through three regional supplemental qualifiers,
                reducing the sport's concentration in certain regions while maintaining competitiveness. This aligns
                with the goals of the 2009 qualification reforms as outlined by the Division I Wrestling Committee Chair
                and Big Ten Conference Deputy Commissioner, Brad Traviolia <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="Wrestling committee recommends allocation plan.">(Johnson, 2008)</cite>.</p>

            <p>Reducing the number of qualifying events will make it easier for fans to keep track of the results from a
                more concise set of qualifiers taking place during the weekend. This provides increased exposure to
                athletes from programs that may not have received much attention during the regular season, promoting
                their visibility leading up to the NCAA Wrestling Championships.</p>

            <p>In addition, with fewer Division I wrestling competitions taking place on the qualifier weekend,
                officiating at qualification events will be more consistent with one another, aligning better with the
                standards set for the NCAA Championships. This enhances the integrity of the entire competition.</p>

        <h3>3. At-large Qualification</h3>

        <ul>
            <h5>About</h5>

            <p>At-large Qualification is a process in which deserving athletes within each weight class who have not yet
                been
                awarded a bid to the NCAA Wrestling Championships may be awarded bids to the NCAA Wrestling
                Championships by the NCAA Wrestling Selection Committee.</p>

            <h5>Dates and Schedule</h5>

            <p>At-large selections will be made by the committee and announced on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monday, March 9, 2025 (Along with the National Championship)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Eligibility</h5>
            <p>To be eligible for consideration an athlete must meet each of the
                following
                criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is competing in the designated weight class on the NCAA Division-I starters page in TrackWrestling.
                </li>

                    selection.</li>
                <li>Competed in one of the following:</li>

                <li>Designated as an at-large contender during the Direct Qualification process.</li>
                <li>Finished top-six at a Supplemental Regional Qualifier</li>
                <li>Member of a program represented at the NCAA Wrestling Championship Quarter-finals.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Process</h5>

            <p>The NCAA Wrestling Committee will select the at-large athletes from the pool of athletes meeting the
                above
                defined criteria.</p>

            <p>Prior to seeding, an updated set of Coaches Rank, RPI, and Winning Percentage will be provided for each
                athlete.</p>

            <p>The metrics to be considered by the committee when selecting at-large athletes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Winning Percentage against the Qualifiers</li>
                <li>Winning Percentage</li>
                <li>Head-to-Head Competition</li>
                <li>Quality Wins</li>
                <li>Results Against Common Opponents</li>
                <li>Coaches Rank</li>
                <li>Ranking Percentage Index Rank </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h5>Benefits, At-Large Qualification</h5>



        <p>The at-large selection process has been improved to no longer require elite athletes who had their bid stolen
            from them to secure an at-large bid.</p>
        <p>The new at-large process considers only athletes who narrowly missed qualification in the direct qualifier
            process or through placement in a supplemental qualifier, as well as those athletes on teams who were unable
            to compete in a supplemental qualifier because their team was competing in the NCAA Wrestling Championship.
            This narrows the field of athletes under consideration.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <p>The selection process for conference pre-allocations is already a proxy for direct selection
                            of athletes. This change simply formalizes the process and directly ties the pre-allocated
                            bids to the athletes who earned them. Currently athletes are required to compete in the
                            conference tournament in order for the conference to retain the bid. This means that the bid
                            is for the athlete currently.</p>
                        <p>This change eliminates the problematic process of stealing bids and having to defend them.
                            There are three main issues with this process:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Only athletes in that specific conference are able to compete for the bid, which
                                unfairly removes opportunities for some athletes based on their conference affiliation
                                while giving greater opportunities to others based on their conference affiliation.</li>
                            <li>Athletes in a conference with a lot of allocations must compete in an excessive number
                                of matches just to determine allocations that have no conference placement value for the
                                team (e.g. determining 12th place in a conference tournament). This puts an unreasonable
                                burden on the athletes.
                                The system does not ensure that the top athletes in the country qualify for the NCAA
                                tournament. Qualification is based on performance within a conference rather than a
                                national or regional field of competitors.</li>
                            <li>The system does not ensure that the top athletes in the country qualify for the NCAA

                                national or regional field of competitors.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The new direct qualification process rewards athletes who perform at a high level throughout
                            the season while representing their team in team competitions. It ensures that the top
                            athletes will earn their way into the NCAA Championships. Additionally, it provides an
                            avenue for other athletes to earn their own bids to the NCAA individual championship, even
                            if they were not selected as direct qualifiers.</p>
                        <p>This process also helps to eliminate the issue of injured athletes defaulting out at
                            qualifying events in order to preserve their path through an at-large bid. By earning a
                            direct qualification, there is no need for these athletes to enter an event when they are
                            unable to compete, which improves the integrity of the sport.</p>

                            athletes are the most deserving of inclusion in the championship. These athletes, if they
                            were to fail to qualify through a conference allocation, would likely be given an at-large

                            could actually increase opportunities for athletes by allowing multiple entries per weight
                            class from each school. This would make college wrestling more inclusive and increase equity
                            among athletes. The current system of qualification, with its regional qualifiers and focus
                            on consolidation, has minimized opportunities for individuals and teams to compete in
                            conference championships. The new system aims to address this issue and create a more fair
                            and equitable system for all wrestlers.</p>

                        <p>The season competition is the primary qualification process to the NCAA Wrestling
                            Championships. The majority of athletes will qualify through direct qualification or
                            at-large selection which increases the significance of the results from the season rather
                            than simply focusing on one qualification competition.</p>
                        <p>The supplemental qualifier is designed to provide a path for athletes from programs
                            not competing for a NCAA championship to earn a bid to the NCAA Wrestling Championships.
                            This is achieved by consolidating athletes who have not earned qualification into regional
                            qualifying tournaments. This allows these athletes to compete directly with each other for
                            qualification. This process ensures that
                            athletes from every region of the country have the opportunity to earn representation for
                            their program and themselves based on their performance against other athletes in their
                            geographic region who have not yet been selected to the championship.</p>

                        <p>The at-large consideration process is separate from the supplemental qualifier process and is
                            used to ensure that the top-25 athletes for the season are included in the final field of 33
                            athletes in each weight class. While the supplemental qualifier process may result in some
                            athletes from under-represented programs earning qualification to the NCAA Wrestling
                            Championships
                            despite not having a top-33 quality season, this is not seen as a flaw in the process.
                            Instead, it
                            is a way to provide opportunities for athletes from all programs to earn a place at the NCAA
                            Wrestling Championships and to ensure that the final field is as competitive as possible.
