        <div id="modernizing"></div>
        <h1>III. Modernizing the Competition Structure</h1>
        <p>The framework proposed in this report, when fully implemented, will modernize the sport in a way that will
            enhance the experience for its key stakeholders. It is important to note that this report will only address
            the structural framework of collegiate wrestling and will not discuss the specific rules of individual
            matches (as outlined in <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Wrestling Rules Book, 2021-22 and 2022-23">Wrestling Rule 2.2.7</cite>). This means that there will be no mention of the competition rules
            for individual matches. The actual wrestling that occurs between two athletes is beyond the scope of this
            report.</p>

        <div id="why"></div>
       
        <p>The forthcoming framework for NCAA Division I Wrestling seeks to uphold the sport's inherent character while seamlessly integrating features from other collegiate sports. This endeavor aims to establish a structure that adheres closely to NCAA regulations. By taking cues from analogous individual sports, wrestling can employ these models as a testing ground to validate proposed alterations. Whenever a change is derived or modified from another NCAA sport, it will be duly noted to indicate its source.</p>
        <h5>Why is change warranted?</h5>
        <p>The Division I wrestling structure presents a unique blend of individual and team competition, with
            occasional conflicts between the two. This duality has historically been a strength of the sport, but the
            current structure fails to effectively balance the two, resulting in conflicting incentives that adversely
            affect both individual and team interests. By revising the structure, it is possible to better align these
            interests and serve Division I wrestling stakeholders more effectively. Moreover, streamlining the
            administration of the sport through greater consistency with other NCAA sports will help modernize wrestling and
            address long-standing issues within the sport.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“Intercollegiate wrestling, being an American development, is an expression of what Americans
                            expect of a sport. At no time have Americans permitted tradition to interfere with their actions
                            when they have thought that a change would result in an improved situation. This attitude has
                            kept all our sports in a state of flux. The rules of wrestling are subjected to constant
                            revision. Our present intercollegiate code does not bear a great resemblance to the one of even
                            fifteen years ago. Many changes have been made, and new ideas have been tried out and have been
                            adopted or discarded as deemed desirable. The Rules Committee has endeavored to regulate the
                            sport so that it will be enjoyable for both the spectator and the participant and still retain
                            all of the features of the wrestling of former years.”</p>

        <div id="seasoncontinuity"></div>
        <h3>A. Scheduling </h3>
        <p>Scheduling of team competitions will have a new framework. </p>
        <ul>

            <h3 id="competitiondeclarations">1. Competition Declarations</h3>
            <p>The wrestling season presents a unique challenge in terms of continuity that is not present in other NCAA sports. While some sports like tennis may have both individual and team competitions, they are not conducted simultaneously during the same part of the season. Wrestling, on the other hand, regularly divides its programs between team dual competitions and individual competitions, leading to a lack of continuity and diminished team aspect. This can discourage fans from investing in team competitions, whether in person or through other media.</p>
            <p>This lack of continuity in wrestling can also result in confusing scenarios, such as when a conference awarded Conference Wrestler of the Week honors to an athlete competing unattached and redshirting while the varsity program was competing in two dual team competitions against other Division I programs (<cite
                    title="Clarion's Murphy named EWL Wrestler of the Week.">FloWrestling Staff, 2014;</cite> <cite
                    title="Wrestling Schedule. The Official Athletics Website of the Clarion Golden Eagles.">Clarion
                    Athletics, n.d.</cite>). Such awards may inadvertently draw attention away from team competitions and towards individual performances, creating an imbalance in the sport.</p>
                    <p>To address this issue, a clear distinction between the two competition structures, individual and team, will be established to better balance the two. This will ensure that each competition structure is given equal weight and recognition and that the team aspect of wrestling is not overshadowed by individual performances.</p>


            <h5>Competition Date Types</h5>
            <p>Each date in which an athlete from the program competes must be one of two possible competition date
                types:</p>
            <ul>



                <h5>Team Date</h5>

                <p>Team dates are dates in which the team conducts team competition with another program utilizing dual
                    meet
                    scoring. Under this format, the result is
                    intended to be recorded on the team's season record.</p>
                <p>Adopting the policy used within Tennis, all team dates are to be counted as a date of competition, no
                    matter the number of athletes participating, or the total number of matches conducted. </p>

            <h5>Process</h5>
            <p>Prior to the start of the season, when a program declares their season of competition, they will also
                need to declare their team competition dates by publishing their season schedule with opponents
                and/or
                events.</p>
            <p>Any date that is declared as a team date is reserved exclusively for team competition. All other
                dates
                may be used for individual competition. </p>
            <p>If an institution encounters extenuating circumstances
                (e.g., natural disaster) that require a change of an already scheduled team competition to a
                different
                date, an individual date may become a team competition date. However, the previously scheduled team
                competition date may not be repurposed as an individual competition date. (Example: A team may not
                reschedule a team competition to allow their athletes to compete in an individual competition that
                was
                scheduled for the same date.)</p>

            <p>A date may only be declared as one type. A date declaration applies to all athletes within the
                program,
                even
                in the event of multi-site or split
                roster competitions.</p>

            <h5>Penalty/Enforcement</h5>
            <p>If a program has engaged in conflicting competition types on the same date, the date
                will
                automatically become a team date.</p>
            <p>Competitions that are not permitted based on the program's selected date declaration type are to be
                updated
                on the athlete's season record form, with any wins recorded by athletes becoming a loss by forfeit.
                Opponents
                will
                record a win by forfeit because of the ineligible athlete competing. Losses recorded by ineligible
                athletes are not to be altered.</p>


            <h5>Benefits, Competition Date Types</h5>
            <p>By reserving team competition dates, athletes and fans can better plan for competitions and ensure that
                all athletes are available for team competition. This structure allows for individual competition, split
                team individual competition, and open competition, but also provides a framework for unifying teams and
                being more inclusive. At the start of the season, programs have complete control over the number and
                type of competition dates they use and when they choose to declare each type of competition date within
                the season. This flexibility in the quantity and type of competition dates allows each program to meet
                its specific scheduling needs. This structure will improve athlete well-being and help athletic
                departments plan more effectively, as there will be less strain on team medical staff due to split
                competitions.</p>

                <p>Note: Multiple-Team Events should not be confused with Multi-Team Events. Both are

                    NCAA Manual and have different definitions.</p>
            </ul>
            <h5>Benefits, Daily Team Limit</h5>

            <p>By limiting team competitions between Division I members, the events that do occur have greater
                significance. These events enhance the fan experience and allow media partners to better package team
                competitions. The use of the Multiple-Team Event and the Isolated Member Exemption serves the
                Association's membership by providing unique opportunities to compete against member programs outside of
                their region without being too burdensome on individual program budgets. This rule also preserves
                longstanding events that are a staple of the collegiate season, while ensuring that the schools
                sponsoring the sport have some control over the limited exempted events. This change provides a more
                inclusive experience for the athletes within a program by incentivizing the scheduling of non-Division I
                programs or scheduling an individual competition when more than one match is desired on a given date,
                allowing more athletes to participate.</p>
            <p>As a result of each program being limited to sponsoring a MTE once every four years, the opportunity for
                different programs to be able to market, promote, and benefit from a unique event will be extended to
                each program. This allows programs to work with outside partners to help market the events as novel
                events which will allow them to reach deeper into their local and regional communities which benefits
                the programs and those wrestling communities in their region <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <p>The National Wrestling Coaches Association (NWCA) All-Star Classic, according to NWCA Executive Director
                Mike Moyer, is intended to "add significant value to amateur wrestling because it serves as a 'kick off'
                event for college wrestling as it showcases amateur wrestling’s heroes and champions all across the
                country" <cite title="An 'All-Star' initiative: Maximizing consumer interest at premier college
                wrestling events">(Cooper, 2009b)</cite>. However, the presence of this event diminishes the
                significance of competition during the season. The matches contested during the event are not official
                and do not hold any significance for the athletes or their teams in the season. The event also distracts
                athletes (and coaches) from focusing on their season events, as it takes place during the season. While
                the event may receive significant interest from fans, it may also diminish the significance of
                subsequent matches that take place during the season for these athletes and/or teams. Support for the
                event has been inconsistent, with sporadic participation by invited athletes and programs, and the event
                was completely cancelled for the 2019 season <cite title="2019 NWCA ALL-STAR Classic Suspended">(Naasz,
                    2019)</cite>. Despite its long history, the event should be discontinued, as it is outdated in the
                modern era where wrestling is readily available to fans through technology. </p>

            <p>All programs will be given an equal ability to schedule events and utilize all the permissible
                scheduling exemptions. The proposed
                Regular Season Multiple-Team Event, which is more inclusive for the sport as it is not restricted to one

            <h3 id="ecm">2. Extra Countable Matches</h3>
            <p>Extra matches are any matches provided to athletes outside of the context of structured event.</p>
            <p>Though extra matches may be held at any point on a team competition date, provided the two opponents are
                attached athletes from teams scheduled to compete in a team competition on the date, it
                is recommended that any additional matches precede the team scored portion of the contest.</p>
            <p>Note: If an extra match take place between athletes and their respective teams are not competing in a
                team dual competition on the date of the extra match, those matches are to be designated as exhibition
                matches and are not to be recorded on an athlete's season record form. </p>

            <h5>Benefits, Extra Matches</h5>

            <p>The use of extra matches is particularly useful for wrestling competitions that are being broadcast on
                linear television networks. This is because wrestling has a unique problem where, unlike other sports,
                if you miss the first 10 minutes of a dual, you miss an entire match. This can be an issue when the
                previous programming, such as a basketball game, goes into overtime and runs long, causing fans who were
                planning to watch the first wrestling match to miss it. This problem even persists at wrestling's
                marquee event, the NCAA Wrestling Finals, where viewers at home often complain about missing portions of
                the first match. This issue may have even been the catalyst for the change in the selection of the
                starting and ending weights for the championship finals <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="Dake, other NCAA wrestlers like the new 'main event' format of shifting order of weight classes.">(Elder,
                    2013)</cite>. </p>

            <p>Including extra matches before the scored team competition allows for more flexibility in programming and
                creates a more inclusive competition for the participating teams by giving more athletes the opportunity
                to compete. It also ensures that spectators at the venue are not delayed in watching wrestling, should
                the competition have to wait for television availability. By including additional matches, fans can
                become familiar with a greater number of athletes within the program, which helps to foster a sense of
                team identity <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="Factors leading to group identification: A field study of winners and losers.">(Fisher &
                    Wakefield, 1998)</cite>. Maximizing the quality and duration of wrestling's programing is important to be well positioned to be attractive for linear television distribution as television is the best medium for attracting spectators to less popular sports <cite

            <p>Athletes don't want to be regulated to non-scored open competitions while their team is competing in
                front of supporting crowds. Extra matches will be possible only in concert with team competitions to extend the experience to additional athletes within the program. This
                inclusion and cohesion with the program will lead to a greater sense of satisfaction for student-athletes <cite

            <h3 id="strategicordering">3. Strategic Match Ordering</h3>
            <p>Strategic match ordering is the process in which weight class order is not sequential and is determined
                based on input from the participating teams' head coaches. This process will replace <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Wrestling Rules Book, 2021-22 and

                in the Wrestling Rules.</p>
            <h5>Process</h5>

            <p>The selection of the match order will take place at the scorer's table prior to the captains' meeting
                with
                the referee.</p>
            <p>The visiting team will have first selection with the home team selecting second and alternating
                between
                the
                two teams until all matches are assigned.</p>
            <p>Any not yet selected weight class may be selected and placed into any position (1 through 10) in the
                order
                for matches to be wrestled.</p>

            <h5>Benefits, Strategic Match Ordering</h5>


            <p>This process gives coaches the ability to make strategic decisions about the order of matches and the
                available athletes for competition. Competing in matches outside of the traditional progression from
                lighter to heavier weight classes may prevent some programs from being able to use certain athletes
                later in the match and could result in certain matchups being locked in. It may also allow coaches to
                hide injured athletes in late match bouts if the outcome of the team competition is not in doubt.</p>

            <p>While this process does not change the wrestling itself, it adds an additional element to the team
                competition and allows coaching staffs to use more strategy to benefit their programs. This structure
                has been introduced into the Division I men's golf championship and has added to the experience of
                athletes and fans <cite title="Coaches to pick match-play lineups at NCAAs.">(Herrington, 2012)</cite>.

            </ul>











            <h5>Process</h5>
            <p>Athletes who are eligible to compete on the date must be declared for each team contest. To be declared
                for a team competition, an athlete must be included on the line-up card presented to the match official
                and opposing coaching staff. </p>

            <p>For dates where more than one team competition will be conducted, the submission of lineups shall take
                place 15
                minutes prior to the scheduled start time of the contest, or immediately following the previous team
                contest
                should the contest be scheduled to start following a preceding contest.
            </p>
            <p>When only one team competition is scheduled to take place on a date, the establishment of lineups is to
                take
                place in concert with the weigh-in.
            </p>

            <p>Athletes are to be declared as only one of three types of athletes for the team contest:</p>

            <ul>
                <p><strong>Committed Athletes</strong> (Team Competition) - Limited to a maximum of ten athletes, one
                    per
                    weight class.
                    Committed
                    athletes are declared as the team's primary competitor at a weight class for the scored team
                    competition.
                    Committed athletes are locked in to compete in their committed weight class, should they compete in
                    the
                    event. Committed athletes ensure there is representation for the team at the weight class in the
                    competition. If the team declines to compete at this weight class, the committed athlete will be
                    charged
                    with a loss by forfeit. Committed Athletes are not eligible to compete in extra countable matches
                    against
                    the opposing
                    team in which they have been declared a committed athlete, nor are they permitted compete in another
                    weight
                    class.</p>
                <p><strong>Rovers</strong> - Limited to a maximum of three athletes for each team, per team competition,
                    and
                    only
                    available when a team has filled each of the ten weight classes with a committed athlete. Rovers are
                    not
                    bound to any specific weight class. They may compete in the team competition at any
                    weight class where they are eligible to compete <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        data-bs-placement="top" title="Wrestling Rules Book, 2021-22 and
                    2022-23">(Wrestling Rule 3.7, Shifts in Weight Class - Dual Meets)</cite>. Rovers are not eligible
                    to
                    compete in
                    extra
                    countable matches against the opposing team in which they have been declared.
                </p>


                <p><strong>Extra Athletes</strong> - Athletes weighed in for the date and are available to compete in
                    extra
                    countable matches against extra athletes for the opposing team. Extra athletes may not compete in
                    the
                    countable team contest. There is no limit in the number of extra athletes a team may weigh-in. A
                    team is not required to
                    fill each weight class in the contested portion of the team competition to have extra athletes
                    compete in extra countable matches.</p>
            </ul>


            <h5>Benefits, Team Competition Lineup</h5>
            <p>Establishing lineups before a contest ensures representation within weight classes. When an athlete is
                placed in the lineup as a committed athlete, they are locked into competing in the team competition.
                This means that the decision on whether the athlete will compete must be made before the team contest
                starts.</p>

            <p>The rover provides flexibility to the program to change the lineup during the contest, if there
                is representation within each weight class in the team contest.</p>

            <p>The number of rovers is determined based on historic travel limits imposed by conferences and a
                reasonable number of options based on the roster size.</p>

            <p>While the use of committed athletes or rovers does not prevent other athletes from competing in matches
                against the opposing team, these additional athletes are designated as extra athletes and may only
                compete in non-scored extra countable matches. They are not permitted to compete in the scored portion
                of the team competition.</p>

            <p>When terminal scoring is used, a team competition will end when the point differential is greater than
                the
                available points remaining for a team to win. The points available should be determined by
                taking
                the number of matches remaining and multiplying by 6.</p>
            <p>When the team competition concludes, the result should identify that not all matches were completed by
                annotating with the number of matches completed in parenthesis preceded by the letter F to signify the
                result is final.</p>
            <ul>
                <p>Example: Team A is down by seven points with one match remaining in the dual. The team
                    competition will end after only nine matches with the annotation of "(F9)" appended to the result to
                    signify
                    that the contest was final after nine matches.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>Terminal scoring is to be used for the NCAA Wrestling Championship. Team Advancement-Tournaments may
                elect
                to implement terminal scoring only if announced prior to the event and applied to all contests held for
                the
                event.</p>
            <p>All team contests, outside of team-advancement tournaments, are to contest all ten matches in a team
                competition,
                even if the team result is determined. However, the score should be recorded as final once the team
                score has
                been decided.</p>

            <p>This
                system has already been adopted for team contests at NCAA Championships:</p>

                        will be stopped once a team winner (four points won) has been determined. The score will only
                        reflect completed
                        matches."</i> - <cite>2022 Division I Men's and Women's Tennis Championships, Pre-Championship

                        team
                        has won three individual matches, any remaining individual matches will be halted at that point
                        with the
                        individual match
                        recorded as it currently stood."</i> - <cite>2022 Division I Men's Golf Championships,

            <h5>Benefit, Terminal Scoring</h5>
            <p>During team championship events, the focus is on the team competition and any matches that are not
                necessary for the competition will not be contested. This eliminates the anti-climactic nature of team
                competitions that continue despite the result already being decided. Under this change, team
                competitions held within the context of a team championship event will always end with a match
                determining the team result. This process is beneficial for mismatches, particularly when combined with
                strategic match ordering, as it creates a power struggle between programs that want to "end the contest
                early" to rest certain athletes and those that want to extend the competition. It also creates an
                incentive for outmatched teams to try to extend the team competition (<cite
                    title="Palmer: Anatomy of the All-Star Classic.">Moore, as cited by Palmer
                    2012</cite>). This system allows for the efficient use of limited national media exposure and
                provides opportunities to redistribute that exposure to other programs, maximizing the benefits for
                wrestling. This is possible due to the nature of scheduling championship events and the benefits of
                linear television distribution (to be discussed later).</p>

            <h3 id="tb">2. Tie-Breaker, Team Advancement</h3>
            <p>The following process will be adopted to replace <i>Rule 3, Section 21. Breaking Ties in Dual Meets and
                    Team-Advancement
                    Tournaments</i> in the NCAA Wrestling Rulebook.</p>




            <p>When a team competition remains tied at the conclusion of 10 matches the result for the team competition
                is to be recorded as a tie. When a tie-breaker is required, the
                following
                process is to be used for determining team advancement.</p>

            <h5>Process</h5>
            <p>Following the conclusion of the team competition, the official timekeeper is to put five minutes on the
                clock. The first tie-breaker round will start when the clock reaches 0:00.</p>
            <p>Each tie-Breaker round is a single individual match of wrestling two minutes in
                length. (i.e. Identical to the first period of any match other than the duration.)</p>
                <p>However, the points accumulate from match to match, as does riding time.</p>


            <p>Though tie breaker rounds are held for a weight class they are not a re-match of the match wrestled at
                the
                weight classification. Any athlete who was eligible to compete in the weight class within the team dual meet is able to compete in a
                tie-breaker round for a given weight.</p>
            <p>A minimum of three rounds is necessary for the tie-breaker.  However, a tie-breaker may conclude before the three rounds have been completed, when a match terminating event, such as
                technical fall, fall, forfeit, or injury default, has taken place.</p>
                <p>Match points are accumulative within tie-breaker matches.  As such, a technical fall may take place when the accumulation of points reaches a margin of 15 points.  For this reason, the team-advancement tie-breaker can be thought of as a super match with three two-minute periods whereby each period is contested at a different weight classification with athletes starting in the neutral position.</p>

            <p>Should the tie-breaker finish the third period with a tied accumulative score, the tie-breaker will continue with an additional period until the tie-breaker has a result of either a terminating event or ends a period with an accumulative point advantage for one team.</p>
            <p>Riding advantage time, injury time, cautions, and stalling will carry over from period to period and be accumulative with the same applications as within a single match.</p>
            <p>Riding advantage time will carry over from period to period and will award an additional point when any team has an advantage of one minute at the end of the third tie-breaker period or any subsequent period.  In the event that one minute of riding advantage time is awarded and results in a tie in the accumulative team points, riding time will be reset to zero, no matter the previous time advantage.  An additional point may be awarded at any additional tie-breaker period when accumulative riding advantage reaches one minute. </p>
            <p>Tie-breaker match order is to be selected by the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>All the weights contested in the dual will be ordered based on the margin of victory.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Margin of victory is calculated by the difference in points in the individual match. (Example: A
                        match ending in a 3-2 decision would be a one-point margin.)</li>
                    <li>Matches that end by Fall will be given a margin of 16 points.</li>
                    <li>Weights that ended by Injury Default, Disqualification, or Forfeit will not be included in a
                        tie-breaker. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>When two weights have the same margin of victory the weight first contested will be the first
                    tie-breaker held.</li>
                <li>Should all (available) weights be contested in the tie-breaker, the tie-breaker will restart the
                    cycle
                    with the weight that started the first tie-breaker. Tie-breakers continue until a winner is
                    determined.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    individual
                    matches. The result of a team tie-breaker is NOT to be included on an athlete's season record form.
                    Tie-breakers are for
                    determining the team result only.</li>
                <li>Athlete's are not limited to competing in only one tie-breaker but if an athlete competes in more
                    than

                    would be
                    restricted from competing in another tie-breaker until rest time has passed.</li>

                <li>This method must be used for breaking ties in all team-advancement
                    tournaments, including the NCAA Wrestling Championship.</li>

            <h5>Benefits, Tie-Breaker (Team Advancement)</h5>


            <p>A tie in team sports may be the most accurate reflection of the team's performance, and it should be
                acknowledged as such. However, it is not a satisfactory result for programs, and this often leads to
                frustration, which has been cited as a reason to eliminate ties. Nevertheless, this frustration can be
                valuable in creating exciting rivalries through spoilers which help to foster an attachment and
                investment into the identity of programs <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="The School We Love to Hate.">(Reimer, 2011)</cite>.</p>

            <p>It is worth noting that ties are commonplace in team contests across various sports, including NCAA
                soccer and ice hockey (National Collegiate Athletic Association, <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    data-bs-placement="top" title="2020-21 AND 2021-22 NCAA Men's and Women's
                    Ice Hockey Rules and Interpretations.">2020a</cite>; <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    data-bs-placement="top" title="2022 and 2023 Soccer Rules Book.">2022n</cite>) and even in the NFL
                on occasion <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Looking back at the most recent ties in NFL history.">(Molski, 2021)</cite>. These ties have
                not prevented the assessment of team performances or the determination of conference or national
                standings. In fact, the NCAA recently changed its soccer rules for the 2022-23 school year to eliminate
                overtime for regular-season contests, a move that may result in even more ties <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="NCAA Announces Changes to Soccer Overtime Rules">(Saint Louis
                    University Athletics, 2022)</cite>.</p>

            <p>However, there are instances where a tie-breaker becomes necessary, such as determining which team
                advances in team advancement tournaments. In such situations, it is best to use actual competition
                between athletes specifically designed to decide the team contest. This process eliminates the current
                practice of using statistical analysis to determine the winner of a tied team contest. Rather than
                relying on the scorer's table to count takedowns, the result of the team contest will be placed back
                into the hands of the competitors, with team advancement determined based on competition on the mat.</p>

            <p>This approach provides fans with the opportunity to witness more wrestling in a close contest and enables
                athletes to step up and secure advancement for their program. By prioritizing the weight class with the
                closest margin of victory, the team result can be determined by re-contesting the closely contested
                weight classes for the specific purpose of deciding the team result.  This creates a tie-breaking match in which multiple athlete are able to contribute and have an impact on the results so that not only one athlete has the responsibility of determining the team result.  However, athletes may single handily determine the team result by securing a terminating result (such as a fall or tech fall).</p>
                <p>This format allows for an additional dynamic within the team competition for athletes and fans in which additional wrestling in close team competitions is used to determine tie-breakers. </p> 
                <p>As a tie-breaker does not count as a match on an athlete's individual season record form, coaches are incentivized to move athletes into non-traditional weight classes based on specific matchups, leading to more unique and exciting matchups without risking a loss on an athlete's season record. This approach not only enhances the overall quality of the sport
                but also provides a fair and exciting way to break ties in team contests.</p>

        <h3 id="d1countable">1. Countable Matches, Division I Opponents</h3>
        <p>Only competitions against rostered athletes competing attached to Division I institutions shall count as
            Division
            I opponents. Any competition against any rostered Division I athlete competing unattached shall not be
            counted as
            a Division I opponent, though the athlete may still be counted as an intercollegiate competition, the same
            as
            competition against another collegiate athlete (NAIA, Division II, Division III, NJCAA, etc.).</p>

        <h5>Benefits, Countable Matches, Division I Opponents</h5>
        <p>The process for qualification to the NCAA (Individual) Championship requires wrestlers be compared against
            the
            field of Division I competitors. Though unattached athletes compete directly with collegiate athletes and
            can
            affect the outcome of matches or tournaments, they are not representing Division I programs when competing
            unattached. As such,
            these matches should not factor into the process for qualification. Though they may be collegiate students,
            when
            competing as unattached athletes, they are not competing as Division I athletes. This provision ensures that
            better comparisons are made between Division I eligible athletes based on the field of athletes that
            competed
            with the support of their Division I institutions. This means that the results which involve unattached
            competitors will not be included or considered when calculating matches completed, RPI, or coaches ranking.
        </p>
        <p>The RPI and Division I Win Percentages will be improved by omitting the unattached competitors which are
            prone to inconsistent results due to the lack of support. This improves the accuracy and reliability of the
            comparison metrics used for qualification purposes.</p>

        <h3 id="enteringcompetition">2. Entering a Competition - Athlete Competition Commitment</h3>


        <p>According to <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="Wrestling Rules Book, 2021-22 and 2022-23">Rule 3.9 Weigh-In Sheet Requirements</cite>, if an
            entrant
            is listed on the NCAA Official Weigh-In Form but does not attempt to make weight, it must be recorded as
            "Did
            Not Enter (DNE)" on the form.</p>

        <p>The act of weighing in for a competition signifies an athlete's consent to compete within the framework of
            the
            competition. When an athlete passes the medical check and weighs in for any individual competition, such as
            an
            individual advancement tournament, open event, pool/round-robin event, or extra matches, they have entered
            the
            competition and are bound to the matches defined in the competition format. The matches they are then
            assigned
            within the event become their committed opponents. Just as with committed athletes in team competitions,
            athletes are committed to competitions for which they have entered.</p>
        <h5>Updates to Rules Book</h5>
        <p>This provision will require some changes to the Wrestling Rules Book with those changes reflected by any

        </p>
        <p>When an athlete is unwilling or unable to compete in a competition they have entered, they may use one of the
            following methods
            of
            withdrawing from their competition provided within the NCAA Wrestling Rulebook under <cite

                <p><strong>Art. 9. Default — Injury.</strong> An injury default is awarded in a match when
                    one of the wrestlers is unable to continue due to an injury or by choice
                    of their coach. An injury default shall be included as a win or loss in each
                    wrestler’s individual season record.</p>




                <p><strong>Art. 11. Forfeit.</strong> A forfeit is received by a wrestler when the opponent, <strong>for
                        any
                        reason</strong>, fails to appear for the match. (Exception: Incidences in which <span

                        met</span>.)
                    In order to receive a forfeit, the non-forfeiting wrestler
                    must be dressed in a competition uniform and appear on the mat. A forfeit shall be
                    included as a win in the victor's individual season record and a loss for the individual
                    forfeiting. Wrestlers shall not accept a forfeit in one weight class and compete in
                    another class. In tournament competition, forfeits advance in a bracket until they
                    meet an opponent. (See Table 4.11.1.)</p>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>If an event would require multiple losses in order to exit the event, an athlete may
            utilize
            the following method to withdraw from subsequent matches:</p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Art. 12. Medical Forfeit.</strong> A medical forfeit is an action that allows a competitor
                    who fails medical examinations, is injured, or becomes ill during the course of
                    tournament competition to forfeit their match(es) without having to weigh in
                    (see Rule 9.1.8 for medical forfeit and weigh-ins for national qualifying
                    events)</span>
                    or show up at the mat. In tournament competition, medical forfeits advance in
                    a bracket until they meet an opponent.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>a. In order for a medical forfeit to be official, the medical personnel, or
                        an authorized institutional representative, shall inform the tournament
                        director before the ill or injured competitor is called to the mat <span
                            class='addition'>provided
                            the following criteria are met: the
                            competitor's previously contested match in the event was recorded as a loss by Default —
                            Injury
                            or
                            Forfeit and the criteria in Rule
                            9.6.3 was met for the previous match. If the previous match was one defined in Rule
                            9.6.4<sup>*</sup>, then the match must not be recorded as a medical forfeit and Rule 2.3.11
                            Forfeit should be
                            applied</span>.</p>

                    <p>b. Medical forfeits count as a win for the opponent and do not count as a
                        loss for the forfeiting wrestler. Even though medical forfeits do not count
                        as a loss, they must be placed on the wrestler's Individual Season Record
                        Form in the Trackwrestling system. </p>

        </ul>

        <p>The use of the medical forfeit allows athletes to withdraw from competition after they have taken a
            loss
            at the event without needing to be charged with further losses.</p>

        <p>The type of previous match will determine which match gets recorded as a loss if an
            athlete is competing at an open event and the losing match was against a non-collegiate. In this
            instance, the loss would be recorded against the next scheduled collegiate athlete.</p>
        <p>This provision does not change the result of the open competition as both matches would be recorded as
            advancements for the other athlete. The only change would be at the administrative level within the
            collegiate program and how they enter the results within the Trackwrestling system.</p>
        <p>The intended purpose of this provision is to minimize any gaming of bout assignments to include matches
            against non-collegiate athletes as a mechanism for athletes to withdraw from a competition without
            impacting their season record form.</p>


    </ul>
    <h5>Benefits, Athlete Competition Commitment - Entering a Competition</h5>

    <p>This system of binding athletes to the competition terms of an event better aligns the expectations for
        competition with the terms of the event. When an athlete enters a competition, they know that failing to
        complete the event undefeated will result in a loss. If an athlete does not want to enter an event due to the
        size of the field or the demands of the competition, they are free to enter other events or have their coaching
        staff schedule extra matches for them alongside their team competitions.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this provision is to ensure that when athletes enter competition and have matches scheduled,
        they are fully committed to the event. While this provision may seem punitive, it helps to communicate results
        more accurately at events. Athletes who suffer losses by forfeit, as well as those who win by forfeit, will
        not have their seeding and committee selections impacted any differently than they are in the current medical
        forfeit provisions. The only difference will be in the reflection on their record, which will be a more accurate
        representation of their performance against the events on their schedule.</p>

    <p>Event organizers may choose to have more limited consolation wrestle-backs if they choose to limit when an event
        terminates. But the terms of the competition must be universally applied to all athletes and defined prior to
        competition.</p>

    <p>Losses by forfeit will be omitted from an athlete's record when calculating RPIs in order to minimize the impact
        on comparisons of athletes based on competitions that did not take place.</p>



    </ul>
    <h3 id="teampoint">3. Team Point Deductions</h3>

    <p>One of the more perplexing provisions in the <i>Wrestling Rules Book</i> is the use of team point deductions as a
        punitive measure. This concept is quite foreign to sports, as it allows a competition official to unilaterally
        alter a team's score based on their judgment, and it contradicts the modern sporting emphasis on the
        accuracy of statistics and historical records.</p>

    <p>While this system was adopted due to the challenges in managing team scoring for individual-centric tournaments, this
        process must be phased out.</p>
    <p>In most other NCAA sports, penalties are handled in a manner that does not directly impact the competition's outcome.
        This is achieved by enforcing rules at the individual level, rather than the team level.</p>

    <p>Wrestling will adopt similar policies by utilizing established procedures from NCAA baseball, soccer, and
        softball to establish a new framework for enforcing infractions that were previously penalized with team point
        deductions.</p>

                                    misconduct will not be credited with points earned before the incident,
                                    nor receive placement points or an individual tournament award. Other
                                    wrestlers will remain in their respective positions on the bracket. In dual-team
                                    advancement tournaments, the flagrant misconduct penalty points are only
                                    deducted for the session in which the offense occurred. (Also see Rule 5.5.9 for

    <h5>Benefits, Eliminating Team Point Deductions</h5>

    <p>The elimination of the team point deduction is a significant change within the sport of wrestling. This
        modification will enable match officials to manage matches more efficiently, as they will no longer need to
        issue a team point deduction as their first violation. This change allows officials to set their standard and
        communicate their expectations to teams by issuing a warning.</p>

    <p>Moreover, eliminating the team point deduction means that officials will not be making subjective judgments that
        directly affect the scoring of events. This will result in a more consistent standard of scoring and allow teams
        to respond better to the expectations of officials. It also ensures that a team's performance is solely based on
        their skills and tactics rather than the subjective interpretation of a match official.</p>

    <p>By implementing these changes, wrestling can create a fairer and more transparent competition environment, which
        aligns with the modern sporting society's emphasis on accuracy and fairness. These changes will also encourage
        greater sportsmanship and encourage athletes to compete to the best of their abilities, free from the worry of
        potential subjective rulings that could significantly impact the match outcome.</p>

                    <p>Athletes know when they enter a competition that a loss is possible. Attempting to compete
                        injured would increase the probability of the athlete suffering a loss and that loss having a

                    What is the point of having coaches pick the order of matches in a dual when all matches are going

                    <p>While it is true that in regular season dual meets all weight classes will be contested, the
                        selection of order for weight classes may impact on the athletes that a coach decides to use
                        within those weight classes.</p>
                    <p>As all weights be contested, the specific order is not important. The currently structure's only
                        benefit is to provide flexibility for programs wanting to bump up athletes throughout a
                        competition.</p>
                    <p>By changing the progressive increase in weight classes that has been traditionally been used and
                        by having a limited number or alternate wrestlers (rovers) programs can selectivly and
                        strategicly attempt to push for specific matchups or to hide athletes that they may only want to
                        be used when the team result is on the line late in a contest.</p>
                    <p>This system provides flexibility for programs while giving a strategic competition dynamic to the
                        team competitions that is not currently in place today.</p>
