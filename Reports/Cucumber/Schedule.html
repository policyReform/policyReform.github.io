                    <h3 id="start">1. Start of the Season</h3>
                    <p>The start of the season will remain unchanged for Division I wrestling.</p>
                    <p>By not moving the start date of the season, student-athletes will not have their first
                        competitions and weight-certification pushed deeper into the semester where it could create
                        conflict with the end of semester academic demands.</p>
                    <h3 id="postseason">2. Postseason</h3>

                    <p>The postseason competition schedule will maintain the same spread between the final date of
                        regular
                        season competition and the start date of the NCAA (Individual) Wrestling Championships. The
                        break
                        between competition prior to the individual championship will only be reduced by one day for the
                        teams competing for a National Championship compared to the break most teams had
                        prior to
                        the 2022 championship.</p>
                    <p>This use of the competition schedule within the established timelines allows for the adoption of
                        the
                        new competition structure without needing to wait for a new championship bidding cycle. As a
                        result,
                        we can view the schedule within the context of the 2025 wrestling season where the
                        championship has been awarded to the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania <cite

                    <p>The postseason accommodates the individual and team components utilized throughout the wrestling
                        season while keeping the primary focus on team competition until the team championship has been
                        determined. It is at that point that the focus shifts to individual championships balancing the
                        team and individual interests of the season competition structure <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    <p>Although the season will be extended by one week, the training and competition duration for
                        athletes will not be expanded. The length of the season will remain unchanged, adhering to <cite
                            data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                            title="2021-22 NCAA Division-I Manual, 17.27.1 Length of Playing Season, Men's Wrestling.">NCAA

                            17.27.1</cite>, which limits the season to 144 days, which can be divided into two segments.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, wrestling will adopt the NCAA Rule 17.1.7.10 Three-Day Period, which will extend
                        the season without requiring additional competition while also ensuring that student-athletes
                        are provided with an opportunity to provide time with family for the holidays.</p>
                    <ul>

                        <p><strong><cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                                    title="NCAA Division I Manual, 17.1.7.10 Three-Day Period -- Basketball">17.1.7.10
                                    Three-Day Period -- Basketball.</cite></strong><i> "In basketball, an institution
                                shall provide student-athletes with three
                                consecutive days off during the institution's official vacation period after the first
                                term of the academic year (e.g., winter
                                break). Required athletically related activities are prohibited on such days."</i></p>
                    </ul>



                    <p>By maintaining the same number of competition and training days, programs will have more
                        flexibility to create a
                        competition schedule that best suits their unique needs. This approach better serves the
                        membership as each school may tailor their individual season of competition based on their
                        unique interests and demands such as having different academic calendars, travel, and scheduling
                        concerns, or balancing divergent interests in championship or non-championship segments.</p>

                    <p>This added flexibility will allow for the management of the competition season in a way where
                        programs may choose to provide athletes with extended breaks during exams, holidays, or any
                        other time within the
                        season by defining the period as a segment break. This will enhance the athletes' wellbeing and
                        ensure that they have ample time to
                        prepare for academic success <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <h3 id="seasonShift">B. Shifting the Championship</h3>

            <p>The sport of wrestling faces a challenge in terms of consumption of the championship due to its
                proximity to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship and high school state wrestling
                championships <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Evolving the core product: Stakeholder’s perceptions of the
                NCAA wrestling season">(Cooper & Weight, 2011)</cite>. The men's basketball tournament, known as March
                Madness, has become a popular event, even among those who do not otherwise follow college
                basketball. High school wrestling championships also draw in potential lifelong fans of wrestling.
                As a result, wrestling stakeholders, via the Blue Ribbon Task Force for wrestling's future, have
                proposed moving the sport to the spring to avoid competing
                with these events <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Could college wrestling be on the verge of monumental changes?">(Hamilton, 2017)</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>However, after conducting an extensive analysis which included the modeling of various options, an alternative solution has been identified that better serves wrestling's mutliple objectives. This plan involves restructuring the schedule in two phases: Phase II is the preferred plan, with Phase I only to be adopted if the restructuring is
                implemented in a year in which the championship site host has already been determined, resulting in
                a fixed date for the individual championship. The difference between the two phases is only one
                week. Phase II calls for pushing back the NCAA (individual) Championships one week. While this
                change is relatively 
                small the impact is significant for wrestling as it allows the sport to take advantage of a media
                vacuum created by other sports avoiding competition during the men's basketball championship,
                thereby maximizing reach, and creating value for media partners.</p>
            <p>The shift of wrestling to compete one week later in the year moves the wrestling postseason from
                the beginning of the men's and women's college basketball post season to the middle of their post
                season. This shift may seem insignificant but the structures of those events and the nature of
                tournament competition which reduces the field of competitors throughout the postseason means that
                the competition with wrestling is greatly diminished.</p>

                <p>Simply holding a wrestling championship is not enough to generate interest in the event. To maximize
                    its potential, it must be strategically planned to minimize obstacles for potential spectators.</p>

                <p>While college basketball attracts the greatest media coverage and athletic competition consumption,
                    not all college basketball games have the same level of competition for wrestling. The primary
                    competition for wrestling is top-six men's college basketball conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten,
                    Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC), as these programs generate the highest TV ratings.</p>

                <p>Outside of this group, wrestling faces less competition from other men's conferences and women's
                    college basketball in terms of attracting spectators and TV viewers. Therefore, the college
                    basketball season has been analyzed to identify windows where wrestling can gain exposure during a
                    lack of top-six competitions.</p>
                <p>There are two primary windows that develop for wrestling:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p><strong>Championship Week</strong> (Window: Sunday, March 6, 2022-Monday, March 7,
                        2022)</p>

                    <p>Championship week, as named by ESPN, refers to the week when the top-six men's college basketball
                        conference championship tournaments are held <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                            data-bs-placement="top"
                            title="Before the Madness: 61 games on ESPN, action on CBS.">(Hiestand, 2003)</cite>. It is

                    </p>

                    <p>To prepare for the conference tournament, teams avoid scheduling games on Sunday and Monday to
                        allow for rest and travel. If there is a Sunday game, it is typically an early mid-day game,
                        creating a window from mid-day Sunday to Tuesday with limited men's college basketball
                        competition.</p>

                    <p>Some mid-major conferences have moved their tournament games earlier in the season to gain
                        national exposure, with the opportunity to play their championship game on Monday or Tuesday
                        night in primetime on national TV when the top-six conferences are not playing.</p>

                    <p>This window, with limited programming available, allowed the Big 12 Conference Wrestling
                        tournament finals to be broadcast nationally on ESPN Sunday night <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                            data-bs-placement="top"

                            2022)</cite>. The semi-finals and finals of the NCAA Wrestling (Team) Championship are
                        scheduled to be held in phase I during this window. In phase II, the second-round duals hosted
                        by top-seeds in their home arenas are scheduled to take place, competing with mid-major
                        basketball, where wrestling television programming is more competitive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Selection Sunday</strong> (Window: Sunday, March 13, 2022-Monday, March 14,
                        2022)</p>


                    <p>Selection Sunday is the day when the season ending tournaments are announced <cite

                    <p>The evening of Selection Sunday, along with the Monday following is the only time within the
                        whole men's college basketball season guaranteed to not have any games. This is a result of
                        <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

                            17.4.4</cite> which prevents basketball teams from playing any regular season games after
                        their conference tournament started. And with each conference now using a conference tournament
                        to determine their conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Championship <cite

                            2016)</cite>, this leaves only season ending tournaments as options for games to be played
                        at these times. But since the selection of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball tournament is
                        announced that evening, teams are awaiting to learn of their possible selection into the NCAA
                        Championship. This has a cascading effect as the inclusion (and exclusion) of teams in this
                        event dictates the teams that play in the other post-season competitions such as the National
                        Invitational Tournament, The Basketball Classic <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    </p>
                    <p>It is within this window that wrestling has the opportunity within phase II to place the NCAA
                        Wrestling (Team) Semi-Finals and Finals with little, if any, competition from other collegiate
                        programming.</p>
                </ul>

                <p>Consumer behavior habits have a greater impact on television consumption than supply and demand of
                    programming <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="NCAA staggers March Madness start times">(Vergeer et al., 2012)</cite>, meaning that
                    people are likely to watch what is available to them when they sit down to watch TV on the channels
                    (or streaming services) they regularly look to for programing. This makes
                    windows with limited programming a valuable opportunity for wrestling and its media partners, as
                    they can provide consumers with something to watch even if it is not what they originally intended
                    to watch.</p>

                <p>By focusing on weeknight competitions, the wrestling championship brings team competitions to
                    consumers during prime television consumption when they have limited time for alternative leisure
                    activities which increases the likelihood of consuming the wrestling championship <cite

                        2018)</cite>.</p>
                <p>While there is no guarantee that championship media partners will pick up all, or any, of the
                    programing options for distribution on linear television, the odds are greatly increased due to the
                    lack of competition.</p>
                <p>The viability of the championship is not dependent on linear television distribution. Any media
                    partner holding the distribution rights for the championship will make the events available to
                    consumers even if only through streaming services.</p>

                <h3 id="individualChampionship">2. Individual Championship</h3>


                <p>The rescheduling of the individual wrestling championship to one week later (phase II) will have a
                    significant impact on the sport's ability to draw media attention and audiences. This is because the
                    event will follow the team-advancement championship, which will attract new fans, and be scheduled
                    at a time with less competition from other NCAA championships. Although there will still be some
                    basketball championships during this time, the reduced competition will make it easier for news and
                    media companies to cover wrestling. Additionally, many people will be looking for more sports
                    programming after the start of March Madness, and wrestling will be one of the limited options
                    available during the second week which has a reduction in sports programming.</p>

                <p>March Madness and its
                    media partners have adopted a staggered schedule for championship games, allowing games to start
                    roughly every 30 minutes <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="NCAA staggers March Madness start times">(Sugiura, 2011)</cite>. This enables fans to
                    watch the endings of each game and ensures no more than two games are on at a time. This is
                    beneficial for the wrestling championship as there may be instances when March Madness games are not
                    competitive, and the ending may not be desirable for fans to watch. This results in consumers seeking
                    alternative programming. With even fewer basketball games during phase II programming, curious fans,
                    including those with prior wrestling experience, can watch wrestling, increasing the sport's
                    exposure and value.</p>

                <p>It's crucial to have the college wrestling season follow the high school championships to attract
                    interest from the high school and youth wrestling communities. These communities have strong
                    interpersonal connections that greatly influence their members <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    seen as a fun spectator activity that brings together people who love the sport, regardless of their
                    competitive goals or past achievements, for children to develop an interest in it beyond personal

                <p>The primary motivation for children's participation in youth and high school sports is the enjoyment

                <p>The tournament competition model common in wrestling at the youth and high school level has an
                    inherent emphasis on competition and performance by design. This competition structure where only

                <p>The loss of participants when competition intensifies and becomes results-oriented is not exclusive
                    to wrestling. Nonetheless, for many sports, individuals who stop participating still
                    benefit from the social aspects of the sport and maintain relationships within the community as fans

                <p>Even though the individuals that remain active as participants are less motivated by the social
                    aspects of the sport over time, it
                    does not mean that the social aspects are insignificant. Without the social aspect of the sport,
                    even participants do not develop a long-term attachment to the sport outside of their personal
                    competitive
                    ambitions. This leads to not only a lack of consumption of wrestling by
                    former participants of the sport but a complete detachment from the sport in many instances.</p>
                <p>This is college wrestling's consumption problem.</p>

                    understand and enjoy the
                    sport. However, there is a relatively weak culture of consumption of college wrestling due in large
                    part to
                    competition structures which has placed a significant emphasis on individual competition and a
                    scheduling structure which leads to significant competition with alternative programing including
                    youth and high school competitions.</p>

                <p>Cultivating a culture of socialization around competition is only possible if the competition
                    structure makes the sport accessible to non-experts who can pick up an understanding of the
                    competition at any point in the season, just as March Madness has done.</p>
                <p>The changes to the championship format proposed for college wrestling here do not require
                    individuals to have an extensive knowledge about any athletes or teams. While it would be ideal to
                    have consumers engaged throughout college wrestling's regular season, consumers are able to start
                    following the sport at the postseason and fully understand the competition.</p>


                <p>The team-centric format is ideal for ease of consumption as spectators will naturally pick a side in

                <p>This schedule is optimized for television and streaming distribution, which greatly reduces consumer
                    friction. It allows individuals to become naturally educated about the teams and athletes through
                    limited exposure to college wrestling during the team-advancement format. This will naturally lead
                    to increased real engagement within these communities, as sports consumers are highly likely to seek
                    out others who share their interest in the sport while watching the sport <cite

                <p>The team championship serves as a gateway to the individual championship, drawing in potential fans
                    who have developed an affinity for the participating individuals and teams. Through the school
                    brands and a simple team competition format, the team championship generates interest in the
                    individual championship, making it appealing to those who have previously not watched it. After the
                    team competition, viewers will have a desire to see more and will be curious about potential
                    match-ups that didn't occur during the team competition.

            <p>The Blue Ribbon Task Force has made a recommendation for Division I Wrestling to become
                a single semester spring sport <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Proposed Future Changes For NCAA Wrestling Season.">(Holmes, 2017)</cite>. According to
                Troy Nickerson, a member of the task force, a motivation for moving wrestling was to improve athlete
                academic performance. The hypothesis being that student-athlete
                academic performance within wrestling has been reduced due to the high number of first-generation
                students, the stress of starting college training, and going through the weight certification
                process while trying to prepare for fall semester finals <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                student-athletes. Student-athletes perceive their academic situation as being more difficult than
                non-athletes due to their athletic commitments, despite student-athlete academic performance being
                consistent with non-athletes who enter college with similar levels of academic preparedness, even at

            <p>A further analysis, specific to Division I wrestler academic performance, is possible by reviewing

                difference in grade point averages for Division I wrestlers
                between the fall semester and spring semester the results were not statistically significant. This
                study reaffirmed the previous research findings that high profile revenue sports, identified within
                this study as men's basketball, baseball, and football, have a negative effect on student-athlete
                academic performance compared to Olympic men's sports. According to <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <p>The GPAs of all athletes trend upward over time and as a result, freshmen having a lower GPA or fall
                grades being slightly lower than spring grades is consistent with this trend <cite

                likely to not
                be prepared for college when compared to their peers whose parents attended college <cite

                which has the

                would expect
                to see a difference between the fall to the spring semester GPAs as well as a significant difference
                in the number
                of credits earned between the two semesters.</p>

                semester as the spring semester.</p>
            <p>It is frequently observed that NCAA student-athletes will earn fewer credits during a semester where they
                are expected to experience greater demands or are still in the process of acclimating themselves to the
                rigorous demands of college life <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

                practice within NCAA athletic departments that allows students to be well positioned for academic
                success. </p>

            <p>If wrestling coaches, administrators, and academic advisors believed the composition of wrestling's
                seasonal acclimation period led to a
                reduction in academic performance within the fall semester then we should see a rebalancing of the
                academic courseload for wrestlers to mitigate the effects. However, we don't observe this practice
                for Division I wrestling when we review the data <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="In-Season vs. Out-of-Season Academic Performance of College Student-Athletes.">(Scott et
                    al., 2008)</cite>.</p>


            <p>This lack of academic load balancing is likely an indication that a change in the season will not
                result in a change to academic performance for wrestlers within programs.</p>

            <p>The lack of academic load balancing may not be due to NCAA wrestling but rather due to the nature of
                competition and training for Division I
                wrestlers when they are outside of the NCAA wrestling season. As noted by <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                the proliferation of clubs and Regional Training Centers imbedded within Division I programs <cite

                wrestlers
                continue to compete with their coaches and teammates following the NCAA season through the spring
                semester simply under a different team name (<cite

                continue through the spring semester, the wrestling season for NCAA athletes and coaches continues
                through
                the spring semester. This likely explains why we don't see Division I wrestlers earning more credits
                in the
                spring than they do in the fall.
            </p>
            <p>This also explains why Division I wrestlers want to see a mandatory three days a week off from training outside the NCAA season, a position endorsed by the athletes from very few other Division I sports <cite title="Results of Division I Time Demands Survey">(NCAA Research, 2016)</cite>.  </p>
            <p>Though the NCAA wrestling season may have ended, the wrestling season for NCAA Division I wrestlers
                continues. And as such, any policy change made for NCAA wrestling is not going to have a significant
                impact due to this outside competition by wrestlers.</p>

            <p>The phenomenon of unattached competition is more likely to have an impact on student-athlete academic
                progress, no matter what the semester distribution. This unique aspect of the sport
                has a rich history and is intricately intertwined with Division I wrestling.</p>

            <p>To better understand this issue, it's important to understand the history and progression of
                collegiate competition in general.</p>

            <p>The origins of college sports can be traced back to athletic clubs established on college campuses. These

            <p>The height of competition between college programs and non-collegiate programs was during World War

                with competitions against military service football teams comprised of service men training for the

                    title="120 years of American education : a statistical portrait.">(Snyder, 1993)</cite>. This
                expansion coincided with the NCAA asserting more control over collegiate competition, ending their
                association
                with the AAU, implementing the "sanity code", and adopting a professionalized staff and
                headquarters. This allowed for a significant decline in the competition between collegiate programs
                and non-collegiate programs, particularly within team competitions <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="In the Arena: The NCAA's First Century">(Crowley, n.d.)</cite>.</p>
            <p>To this day, NCAA programs remain permitted to compete against non-collegiate teams. It is for this
                reason new and emerging sports are possible. When the University of Minnesota-Morris launched
                the first ever women's collegiate wrestling program the only way to compete was by entering Canadian
                and USA Wrestling events <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="#WomensWednesday: The history of WCWA Nationals and why it matters so much.">(Abbott,

            <p>In many sports, especially individual sports, the rules for collegiate competitions are the same as
                those for other organizations, leading to no distinction between the competitions. Nine NCAA sports
                even use another organization's rulebook instead of producing their own, such as NCAA rifle
                following USA Shooting's rules and NCAA skiing adhering to the International Ski Federation's rules
                <cite title="Overview of the NCAA Playing Rules Process">(What is a playing rule?,
                    n.d.)</cite>. As a result, there is minimal difference between intercollegiate and open
                competitions. Athletes in these sports produce the same times or scores irrespective
                of the competition being an open event or an intercollegiate event. By competing within open
                competitions, collegiate programs can enter more
                local events minimizing the expense of operating a program while still providing athletic
                opportunities to athletes.
            </p>

            <p>Though this blending of collegiate and non-collegiate competitors raised regulatory concerns for the
                NCAA,
                including questions about the eligibility of student-athletes. The NCAA prohibits athletes, during
                the season, from
                competing on teams outside of their institution, except when participating for an Olympic or
                National Team <cite title="NCAA Division I Manual">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,
                    2021d)</cite>.
                However, athletes engaging in personal activities has been viewed differently than engaging in team
                competition. The wide range of levels of individual competition in open events, from local charity
                fun-runs to
                events featuring Olympians, made it challenging to create consistent standards for member
                institutions and student-athletes. To minimize the regulatory burden of reviewing each possible
                event a student-athlete may want to enter and because individual athlete participation in open
                events was not considered an impact on collegiate competition, the NCAA took a hands-off approach and
                implemented the <i>unattached individual athlete provision</i> (codified in rule 17.33.1.8)</p>

                        student-athlete's sport, as long as the
                        student-athlete represents only the student-athlete in the competition and does not engage
                        in such competition as a member
                        of or receive expenses from an outside team.</i>
                </p>
            </ul>

            <p>In collegiate wrestling, the use of unattached athletes is more prevalent than in any other sport,
                despite a high attrition rate of athletes not completing their athletic eligibility <cite
                    title="Why Redshirt?">(Levendusky, 2021)</cite>. This practice has a significant impact
                on student-athletes. Not only do student-athletes have to bear the expenses themselves, but they are
                also not
                allowed to receive coaching from their college coaches, and open tournament structures require a
                considerable time commitment <cite

            <p>Financial concerns are a significant stressor for student-athletes, ranking third according to an
                NCAA survey <cite title="NCAA Student-Athlete Well-Being Study (Fall 2021)">(NCAA Research,
                    2022)</cite>. This burden is felt even more acutely by first-generation students, who report
                nearly double the stress levels regarding their ability to pay for their education compared to their
                peers <cite title="First-Generation Students' Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic.">(Soria et
                    al.,
                    2020)</cite>. Furthermore, a study on collegiate financial wellness found that first-generation
                students are less equipped to manage their finances <cite
                    title="Financial Experiences Among First-Generation College Students.">(Study on Collegiate
                    Financial Wellness, 2020)</cite>.</p>

            <p>The financial burden of participating in wrestling can be substantial due to the limited scholarship
                support for non-headcount sports <cite
                    title=" November 10). <cite>Defining Head Count and Equivalency Sports">(Kruhm, 2021)</cite>.
                Despite this, there is a widespread expectation that athletes will compete unattached, which one
                head coach estimated would cost an athlete an extra $900 per season <cite
                    title="Wrestling: an inside look at competing 'unattached' as an Ohio State wrestler.">(Helfrich,
                    2017)</cite>.</p>

            <p>Unattached competition in collegiate wrestling not only places a financial burden on athletes but
                also extends to their time commitment. Due to the structure of unattached competitions, athletes
                only compete in tournament events, which can lead to prolonged competition days, further exacerbated
                by the need for carpooling and waiting for their group's final athlete to finish before leaving.
                Even though most competitions on intercollegiate schedules are single dual meets, wrestling has the
                second-highest average time commitment per competition day among all NCAA sports. This time burden
                is particularly onerous for unattached athletes, who are subjected to an even greater time
                commitment than the average collegiate wrestler.</p>

            <p>Athletic activity can negatively impact academic performance as athletes may spend more time on their
                sport than they realize. According to <cite title="Study probes time allotments.">Paskus
                    (2008)</cite>, athletes may experience a decrease in the time they dedicate to their academics
                when they increase their athletic activity. In addition, athletes may underestimate the amount of
                time they allocate to their sport during the season. For example, a study conducted by <cite
                    title="The 20-hour rule: student-athletes time commitment to athletics and academics.">Ayers et
                    al. (2012)</cite> found that while athletes reported spending an average of 21.5 hours a week on
                their sport in-season, their actual time spent on the sport was 31.14 hours per week.</p>

            <p>Unattached competition also presents challenges for athletes, beyond just the financial expenses.
                Coaches are not allowed to provide coaching to athletes competing unattached, and the competition
                schedule is often drastically different from the program's posted schedule. This lack of support can
                put unattached athletes at a disadvantage in their training cycles, as their training may not be
                optimized for their competition. This lack of focus from the coaching staff can contribute to the
                high attrition rate and exacerbate the pressures of adjusting to college life <cite title="Pre- to Post-Season Changes in the Intrinsic Motivation of First Year
                            College Athletes: Relationships with Coaching Behavior and Scholarship Status.">(Amorose &
                    Horn, 2001)</cite>.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the unattached athlete provision in collegiate wrestling is no longer relevant in the
                current framework. The original idea behind this provision was that open competitors, even if they
                were collegiate athletes competing individually, would not have any impact on the collegiate season
                and therefore did not require regulation from the association. This notion has since become
                obsolete.</p>

            <!--<p>Currently, the provision has become an indispensable component of collegiate wrestling, allowing
                    non-collegiate and collegiate rostered competitors to participate in the same events. As a result,
                    unattached competitors have a direct impact on the Division I collegiate season.</p>
                -->
            <p>Despite the perception that unattached competition is solely developmental and has little impact on
                an individual's or team's collegiate career, since 2006 an unattached match may count retroactively
                if a redshirt
                is pulled <cite title="Wrestling Rules Book, 2005-06.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,
                    2006)</cite>. Thus, each unattached competition could have the same significance as an official
                collegiate competition. Consequently, athletes and coaches are aware of this, making unattached
                competition, in effect, no longer a developmental exhibition but an actual collegiate competition,
                further
                burdening unattached athletes.</p>

            <p>Unattached athletes compete directly with collegiate athletes and can influence the outcome of
                matches and national tournament qualifications. The Division I qualification system considers
                unattached competitors as intercollegiate competition, and the results against these competitors are
                included in the calculation of RPIs. This factor affects not only the athletes who enter open
                competitions but also their opponents who do not compete in any open competitions throughout the
                season. The inconsistent results from unattached competitors, caused by the lack of support, raise
                concerns about the reliability of win percentages and RPIs for qualification purposes <cite
                    title="2021-22 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships Selection Criteria Grid.">(National
                    Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d. -am)</cite>.</p>

            <p>The challenges faced by unattached athletes are well-known within the sport, with coaches frequently
                discussing the issues surrounding their participation. However, despite these challenges, coaches appear
                unwilling to encourage the burning of a season of eligibility to gain the full benefits of collegiate
                athletic participation <cite title="What will it take for NCAA to change wrestling rule?">(Hamilton,
                    2015)</cite>. It has become standard practice to expect student-athletes to endure these burdens to
                benefit the program should the student-athlete remain a member of the program in five-years time.</p>

            <!-- <p>While the NCAA has adopted a hands-off approach to the provision for unattached athletes. This approach
                has been eroded, particularly in wrestling, where issues frequently arise due to the provision's
                widespread use.</p>
-->
            <p>Despite open (unattached) competition being viewed as competition outside the NCAA's purview, NCAA
                wrestling
                has increasingly adopted an authoritative position over rostered athletes competing as individuals, even
                when unattached. The sport has dictated provisions around weight classes, restricted the timing of
                competitions <cite title="NCAA Manual 17.33.1.8.1 Exception. Wrestling.">(17.33.1.8.1)</cite>, and even
                brought unattached competition under the NCAA's purview for the purpose of enforcing administrative
                violations upon wrestlers <cite title="NCAA Manual 17.33.1.8.1 Exception. Wrestling.">(Wrestling
                    Rule 8.4.)</cite>. This has increased the administrative burden required to operate a wrestling
                program.</p>
            <p>Unlike other NCAA individual sports which follow the rules and recommendations of a national sport body,
                wrestling has its own rulesbook and rules committee, which changes the paradigm of open competition for
                wrestling. The
                distinction between open and intercollegiate events may seem subtle, but it is crucial. Within
                wrestling, only events specifically designed for intercollegiate competition use NCAA rules. If an event
                fails to adhere to these standards, it becomes an exhibition for collegiate athletes <cite
                    title="Extra Matches During Dual Meet and Tournament Competition.">(Barbee, 2020)</cite>.</p>

            <p>The primary purpose of open competitions in wrestling is to permit rostered collegiate athletes to
                compete in college competitions while maintaining their eligibility. Permitting non-rostered open
                competitors in these events is largely only done to remain in compliance.</p>


            <p>The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) identified wrestling's widespread
                use of the provision was perverting the rule's intent and after some attempts to regulate
                the provision concluded the administrative burden was too great. They responded by removing the
                unattached athlete provision from their rules book in 2021 <cite
