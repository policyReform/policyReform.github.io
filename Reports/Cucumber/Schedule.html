                    <h3 id="start">1. Start of the Season</h3>
                    <p>The start of the season will remain unchanged for Division I wrestling.</p>
                    <p>By not moving the start date of the season, student-athletes will not have their first
                        competitions and weight-certification pushed deeper into the semester where it could create
                        conflict with the end of semester academic demands.</p>
                    <h3 id="postseason">2. Postseason</h3>

                    <p>The postseason competition schedule will maintain the same spread between the final date of
                        regular
                        season competition and the start date of the NCAA (Individual) Wrestling Championships. The
                        break
                        between competition prior to the individual championship will only be reduced by one day for the
                        teams competing for a National Championship compared to the break most teams had
                        prior to
                        the 2022 championship.</p>
                    <p>This use of the competition schedule within the established timelines allows for the adoption of
                        the
                        new competition structure without needing to wait for a new championship bidding cycle. As a
                        result,
                        we can view the schedule within the context of the 2025 wrestling season where the
                        championship has been awarded to the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania <cite

                    <p>The postseason accommodates the individual and team components utilized throughout the wrestling
                        season while keeping the primary focus on team competition until the team championship has been
                        determined. It is at that point that the focus shifts to individual championships balancing the
                        team and individual interests of the season competition structure <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                                    Three-Day Period -- Basketball.</cite></strong><i> "In basketball, an institution
                                shall provide student-athletes with three
                                consecutive days off during the institution's official vacation period after the first
                                term of the academic year (e.g., winter
                                break). Required athletically related activities are prohibited on such days."</i></p>
                    </ul>



                    <p>By maintaining the same number of competition and training days, programs will have more
                        flexibility to create a
                        competition schedule that best suits their unique needs. This approach better serves the
                        membership as each school may tailor their individual season of competition based on their
                        unique interests and demands such as having different academic calendars, travel, and scheduling
                        concerns, or balancing divergent interests in championship or non-championship segments.</p>

                    <p>This added flexibility will allow for the management of the competition season in a way where
                        programs may choose to provide athletes with extended breaks during exams, holidays, or any
                        other time within the
                        season by defining the period as a segment break. This will enhance the athletes' wellbeing and
                        ensure that they have ample time to
                        prepare for academic success <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <h3 id="seasonShift">B. Shifting the Championship</h3>

            <p>The sport of wrestling faces a challenge in terms of consumption of the championship due to its
                proximity to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship and high school state wrestling
                championships <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Evolving the core product: Stakeholder’s perceptions of the
                NCAA wrestling season">(Cooper & Weight, 2011)</cite>. The men's basketball tournament, known as March
                Madness, has become a popular event, even among those who do not otherwise follow college
                basketball. High school wrestling championships also draw in potential lifelong fans of wrestling.
                As a result, wrestling stakeholders, via the Blue Ribbon Task Force for wrestling's future, have
                proposed moving the sport to the spring to avoid competing
                with these events <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Could college wrestling be on the verge of monumental changes?">(Hamilton, 2017)</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>However, after conducting an extensive analysis which included the modeling of various options, an
                alternative solution has been identified that better serves wrestling's mutliple objectives. This plan
                involves restructuring the schedule in two phases: Phase II is the preferred plan, with Phase I only to
                be adopted if the restructuring is
                implemented in a year in which the championship site host has already been determined, resulting in
                a fixed date for the individual championship. The difference between the two phases is only one
                week. Phase II calls for pushing back the NCAA (individual) Championships one week. While this
                change is relatively
                small the impact is significant for wrestling as it allows the sport to take advantage of a media
                vacuum created by other sports avoiding competition during the men's basketball championship,
                thereby maximizing reach, and creating value for media partners.</p>
            <p>The shift of wrestling to compete one week later in the year moves the wrestling postseason from
                the beginning of the men's and women's college basketball post season to the middle of their post
                season. This shift may seem insignificant but the structures of those events and the nature of
                tournament competition which reduces the field of competitors throughout the postseason means that
                the competition with wrestling is greatly diminished.</p>

                <p>Simply holding a wrestling championship is not enough to generate interest in the event. To maximize
                    its potential, it must be strategically planned to minimize obstacles for potential spectators.</p>

                <p>While college basketball attracts the greatest media coverage and athletic competition consumption,
                    not all college basketball games have the same level of competition for wrestling. The primary
                    competition for wrestling viewership comes from what is colloquially known as the "T6" or top-six
                    men's college basketball conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten,
                    Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC), as these programs generate the highest TV ratings and program revenue.</p>

                <p>Outside of this group, wrestling faces less competition from other men's conferences and women's
                    college basketball in terms of attracting spectators and TV viewers. Therefore, the college
                    basketball season has been analyzed to identify windows where wrestling can gain exposure during a
                    lack of top-six competitions.</p>
                <p>There are two primary windows that develop for wrestling:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p><strong>Championship Week</strong> (Window: Sunday, March 6, 2022-Monday, March 7,
                        2022)</p>

                    <p>Championship week, as named by ESPN, refers to the week when the top-six men's college basketball
                        conference championship tournaments are held <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                            data-bs-placement="top"
                            title="Before the Madness: 61 games on ESPN, action on CBS.">(Hiestand, 2003)</cite>. It is
                        considered the start of March Madness by many fans <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                            data-bs-placement="top"

                            2020)</cite> and usually starts on Tuesday or Wednesday, lasting until Saturday or Sunday.
                    </p>

                    <p>To prepare for the conference tournament, teams avoid scheduling games on Sunday and Monday to
                        allow for rest and travel. If there is a Sunday game, it is typically an early mid-day game,
                        creating a window from mid-day Sunday to Tuesday with limited men's college basketball
                        competition.</p>

                    <p>Some mid-major conferences have moved their tournament games earlier in the season to gain
                        national exposure, with the opportunity to play their championship game on Monday or Tuesday
                        night in primetime on national TV when the top-six conferences are not playing.</p>

                    <p>This window, with limited programming available, allowed the Big 12 Conference Wrestling
                        tournament finals to be broadcast nationally on ESPN Sunday night <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                            data-bs-placement="top"
                            title="How to Watch Big 12 Championship in College Wrestling: Live Stream, TV Channel, Start Time.">(Habbas,
                            2022)</cite>. The semi-finals and finals of the NCAA Wrestling (Team) Championship are
                        scheduled to be held in phase I during this window. In phase II, the second-round duals hosted
                        by top-seeds in their home arenas are scheduled to take place, competing with mid-major
                        basketball, where wrestling television programming is more competitive.</p>

                    <p><strong>Selection Sunday</strong> (Window: Sunday, March 13, 2022-Monday, March 14,
                        2022)</p>


                    <p>Selection Sunday is the day when the season ending tournaments are announced <cite
                            data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                            title="Everything You Need to Know for Selection Sunday.">(Beller, 2018)</cite>.</p>

                    <p>The evening of Selection Sunday, along with the Monday following is the only time within the
                        whole men's college basketball season guaranteed to not have any games. This is a result of
                        <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                            title="2021-22 NCAA Division-I Manual, 17.4.4 End of Playing Season, Basketball.">NCAA Rule
                            17.4.4</cite> which prevents basketball teams from playing any regular season games after
                        their conference tournament started. And with each conference now using a conference tournament
                        to determine their conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Championship <cite
                            data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                            title="Ivy League, Last Division I Holdout, Add Basketball Tournament.">(Tracy,
                            2016)</cite>, this leaves only season ending tournaments as options for games to be played
                        at these times. But since the selection of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball tournament is
                        announced that evening, teams are awaiting to learn of their possible selection into the NCAA
                        Championship. This has a cascading effect as the inclusion (and exclusion) of teams in this
                        event dictates the teams that play in the other post-season competitions such as the National
                        Invitational Tournament, The Basketball Classic <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                            data-bs-placement="top"

                    </p>
                    <p>It is within this window that wrestling has the opportunity within phase II to place the NCAA
                        Wrestling (Team) Semi-Finals and Finals with little, if any, competition from other collegiate
                        programming.</p>
                </ul>

                <p>Consumer behavior habits have a greater impact on television consumption than supply and demand of
                    programming <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="NCAA staggers March Madness start times">(Vergeer et al., 2012)</cite>, meaning that
                    people are likely to watch what is available to them when they sit down to watch TV on the channels
                    (or streaming services) they regularly look to for programing. This makes
                    windows with limited programming a valuable opportunity for wrestling and its media partners, as
                    they can provide consumers with something to watch even if it is not what they originally intended
                    to watch.</p>

                <p>By focusing on weeknight competitions, the wrestling championship brings team competitions to
                    consumers during prime television consumption when they have limited time for alternative leisure
                    activities which increases the likelihood of consuming the wrestling championship <cite
                        data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        title="Television, capturing America's attention and prime time and beyond">(Krantz-Kent,
                        2018)</cite>.</p>
                <p>While there is no guarantee that championship media partners will pick up all, or any, of the
                    programing options for distribution on linear television, the odds are greatly increased due to the
                    lack of competition.</p>
                <p>The viability of the championship is not dependent on linear television distribution. Any media
                    partner holding the distribution rights for the championship will make the events available to
                    consumers even if only through streaming services.</p>

                <h3 id="individualChampionship">2. Individual Championship</h3>


                <p>The rescheduling of the individual wrestling championship to one week later (phase II) will have a
                    significant impact on the sport's ability to draw media attention and audiences. This is because the
                    event will follow the team-advancement championship, which will attract new fans, and be scheduled
                    at a time with less competition from other NCAA championships. Although there will still be some
                    basketball championships during this time, the reduced competition will make it easier for news and
                    media companies to cover wrestling. Additionally, many people will be looking for more sports
                    programming after the start of March Madness, and wrestling will be one of the limited options
                    available during the second week which has a reduction in sports programming.</p>

                <p>March Madness and its
                    media partners have adopted a staggered schedule for championship games, allowing games to start
                    roughly every 30 minutes <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="NCAA staggers March Madness start times">(Sugiura, 2011)</cite>. This enables fans to
                    watch the endings of each game and ensures no more than two games are on at a time. This is
                    beneficial for the wrestling championship as there may be instances when March Madness games are not
                    competitive, and the ending may not be desirable for fans to watch. This results in consumers
                    seeking
                    alternative programming. With even fewer basketball games during phase II programming, curious fans,
                    including those with prior wrestling experience, can watch wrestling, increasing the sport's
                    exposure and value.</p>

                <h3>3. Competition with High School Championships</h3>

                <p>It's crucial to have the college wrestling season follow the high school championships to attract
                    interest from the high school and youth wrestling communities. These communities have strong
                    interpersonal connections that greatly influence their members <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    leisure and social spectator activity when the communities are strongest, after having spent a full
                    wrestling season together.</p>

                <p>It's widely known that observing skilled athletes compete can improve lower-skilled athletes'

                    college wrestling. But this shouldn't be the only reason for watching wrestling. The sport should be
                    seen as a fun spectator activity that brings together people who love the sport, regardless of their
                    competitive goals or past achievements, for children to develop an interest in it beyond personal
                    competition <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

                <p>The primary motivation for children's participation in youth and high school sports is the enjoyment
                    derived from the participation, which in the early stages of participation is often based on the

                    and subsequent motivation for participation often evolves over time <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                <p>The tournament competition model common in wrestling at the youth and high school level has an
                    inherent emphasis on competition and performance by design. This competition structure where only
                    one athlete wins magnifies athlete failure <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

                <p>The loss of participants when competition intensifies and becomes results-oriented is not exclusive
                    to wrestling. Nonetheless, for many sports, individuals who stop participating still
                    benefit from the social aspects of the sport and maintain relationships within the community as fans
                    <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

                    participant to consumer, usually during adolescence, is driven by peer influence and a desire to
                    stay connected to the sport and community they once enjoyed participating <cite

                </p>


                <p>Even though the individuals that remain active as participants are less motivated by the social
                    aspects of the sport over time, it
                    does not mean that the social aspects are insignificant. Without the social aspect of the sport,
                    even participants do not develop a long-term attachment to the sport outside of their personal
                    competitive
                    ambitions. This leads to not only a lack of consumption of wrestling by
                    former participants of the sport but a complete detachment from the sport in many instances.</p>
                <p>This is college wrestling's consumption problem.</p>

                <p>Wrestling is the sixth most popular high school sport for boys <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    understand and enjoy the
                    sport. However, there is a relatively weak culture of consumption of college wrestling due in large
                    part to
                    competition structures which has placed a significant emphasis on individual competition and a
                    scheduling structure which leads to significant competition with alternative programing including
                    youth and high school competitions.</p>

                <p>Cultivating a culture of socialization around competition is only possible if the competition
                    structure makes the sport accessible to non-experts who can pick up an understanding of the
                    competition at any point in the season, just as March Madness has done.</p>
                <p>The changes to the championship format proposed for college wrestling here do not require
                    individuals to have an extensive knowledge about any athletes or teams. While it would be ideal to
                    have consumers engaged throughout college wrestling's regular season, consumers are able to start
                    following the sport at the postseason and fully understand the competition.</p>


                <p>The team-centric format is ideal for ease of consumption as spectators will naturally pick a side in
                    a two-team competition drawing on outside notions of rivalries <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                <p>This schedule is optimized for television and streaming distribution, which greatly reduces consumer
                    friction. It allows individuals to become naturally educated about the teams and athletes through
                    limited exposure to college wrestling during the team-advancement format. This will naturally lead
                    to increased real engagement within these communities, as sports consumers are highly likely to seek
                    out others who share their interest in the sport while watching the sport <cite

                <p>The team championship serves as a gateway to the individual championship, drawing in potential fans
                    who have developed an affinity for the participating individuals and teams. Through the school
                    brands and a simple team competition format, the team championship generates interest in the
                    individual championship, making it appealing to those who have previously not watched it. After the
                    team competition, viewers will have a desire to see more and will be curious about potential
                    match-ups that didn't occur during the team competition.

            <h3 id="singleSemester">C. Discussion: Single Semester Proposal</h3>

            <p>The Blue Ribbon Task Force has made a recommendation for Division I Wrestling to become
                a single semester spring sport <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Proposed Future Changes For NCAA Wrestling Season.">(Holmes, 2017)</cite>. According to
                Troy Nickerson, a member of the task force, a motivation for moving wrestling was to improve athlete
                academic performance. The hypothesis being that student-athlete
                academic performance within wrestling has been reduced due to the high number of first-generation
                students, the stress of starting college training, and going through the weight certification
                process while trying to prepare for fall semester finals <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <p>This policy proposal, which has shown support from athletes and coaches <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    & Weight, 2011)</cite> may stem from anecdotal evidence based on communications with
                student-athletes. Student-athletes perceive their academic situation as being more difficult than
                non-athletes due to their athletic commitments, despite student-athlete academic performance being
                consistent with non-athletes who enter college with similar levels of academic preparedness, even at
                highly selective colleges (<cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                While college athletics can be a stressor for student-athletes, it's also
                a buffer to stress which helps athletes in their academic pursuits <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    & Freysinger, 2003)</cite>. The academic performance of student-athletes is largely a function of
                their academic motivations <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <p>The literature on the topic of academic performance for student-athletes has largely
                supported the position that academic performance is not hindered by athletic participation (<cite

                    2014</cite>). In a study conducted of major programs, which included wrestling, a negative effect
                for the revenue sports of football and
                basketball was identified with researchers stating: "there is a negative season effect in revenue sports
                but not in
                non-revenue
                sports... Unlike athletes in the revenue sports, participants in nonrevenue sports show no grade
                differential between on- and off-season" <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    & Maloney, 1993)</cite>.</p>

            <p>A further analysis, specific to Division I wrestler academic performance, is possible by reviewing
                research utilizing the NCAA's dataset of sport specific athlete semester grades conducted by <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="In-Season vs. Out-of-Season Academic Performance of College Student-Athletes.">Scott et
                    al. (2008)</cite>. While this research shows a slight
                difference in grade point averages for Division I wrestlers
                between the fall semester and spring semester the results were not statistically significant. This
                study reaffirmed the previous research findings that high profile revenue sports, identified within
                this study as men's basketball, baseball, and football, have a negative effect on student-athlete
                academic performance compared to Olympic men's sports. According to <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="In-Season vs. Out-of-Season Academic Performance of College Student-Athletes.">Scott et
                    al. (2008)</cite>, "the in-season vs. out-of-season GPA differences are enhanced for the males
                in high profile sports in comparison with the effects seen among all other student-athletes in
                Division I."</p>




            <p>The GPAs of all athletes trend upward over time and as a result, freshmen having a lower GPA or fall
                grades being slightly lower than spring grades is consistent with this trend <cite

                    al., 2008)</cite>. Additionally, first-generation students as a group are significantly more
                likely to not
                be prepared for college when compared to their peers whose parents attended college <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Students Whose Parents Did Not Go To College: Postsecondary Access, Persistence,
                        and Attainment.">(Choy, 2001)</cite>. This is significant for the sport of men's wrestling
                which has the
                second highest percentage (23%) of first-generation athletes within all NCAA sports <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="The First in Their Family">(National
                    Collegiate Athletic Association, 2016)</cite>. As a result, we
                would expect
                to see a difference between the fall to the spring semester GPAs as well as a significant difference
                in the number
                of credits earned between the two semesters.</p>

            <p>It is frequently observed that NCAA student-athletes will earn fewer credits during a semester where they
                are expected to experience greater demands or are still in the process of acclimating themselves to the
                rigorous demands of college life <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

            <p>If wrestling coaches, administrators, and academic advisors believed the composition of wrestling's
                seasonal acclimation period led to a
                reduction in academic performance within the fall semester then we should see a rebalancing of the
                academic courseload for wrestlers to mitigate the effects. However, the data doesn't demonstrate the
                practice of academic load balancing within Division I wrestling when we review the data <cite

            <p>This lack of academic load balancing is likely an indication that a change in the season will not
                result in a change to academic performance for wrestlers within programs.</p>

            <p>The lack of academic load balancing may not be due to NCAA wrestling but rather due to the nature of
                competition and training for Division I
                wrestlers when they are outside of the NCAA wrestling season. As noted by <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                through
                the spring semester. This likely explains why we don't see Division I wrestlers earning more credits
                in the
                spring than they do in the fall.
            </p>
            <p>This also explains why Division I wrestlers want to see a mandatory three days a week off from training
                outside the NCAA season, a position endorsed by the athletes from very few other Division I sports <cite

            <p>Though the NCAA wrestling season may have ended, the wrestling season for NCAA Division I wrestlers
                continues. And as such, any policy change made for NCAA wrestling is not going to have a significant
                impact due to this outside competition by wrestlers.</p>

            <p>The phenomenon of unattached competition is more likely to have an impact on student-athlete academic
                progress, no matter what the semester distribution. This unique aspect of the sport
                has a rich history and is intricately intertwined with Division I wrestling.</p>

            <p>To better understand this issue, it's important to understand the history and progression of
                collegiate competition in general.</p>

            <p>The origins of college sports can be traced back to athletic clubs established on college campuses. These
                clubs gained popularity and led to competitions with organizations outside of the campus community

                    1970)</cite> including other college clubs as well as organizations

            <p>In 1921, the NCAA held its first-ever national championship when the University of Chicago hosted the
                NCAA Men's Track &
                Field Championship <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <p>The height of competition between college programs and non-collegiate programs was during World War
                II when many colleges put athletic competition on hold <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                with competitions against military service football teams comprised of service men training for the
                war. This allowed the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks, a military team, to finish second in the 1943 AP

            <p>The post-war period saw a significant increase in college enrollment, propelling the growth of
                college sports <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="120 years of American education : a statistical portrait.">(Snyder, 1993)</cite>. This
                expansion coincided with the NCAA asserting more control over collegiate competition, ending their
                association
                with the AAU, implementing the "sanity code", and adopting a professionalized staff and
                headquarters. This allowed for a significant decline in the competition between collegiate programs
                and non-collegiate programs, particularly within team competitions <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="In the Arena: The NCAA's First Century">(Crowley, n.d.)</cite>.</p>
            <p>To this day, NCAA programs remain permitted to compete against non-collegiate teams. It is for this
                reason new and emerging sports are possible. When the University of Minnesota-Morris launched
                the first ever women's collegiate wrestling program the only way to compete was by entering Canadian
                and USA Wrestling events <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="#WomensWednesday: The history of WCWA Nationals and why it matters so much.">(Abbott,
                    2020)</cite>. This flexibility with competition and scheduling was necessary for subsequent

            <p>In many sports, especially individual sports, the rules for collegiate competitions are the same as
                those for other organizations, leading to no distinction between the competitions. Nine NCAA sports
                even use another organization's rulebook instead of producing their own, such as NCAA rifle
                following USA Shooting's rules and NCAA skiing adhering to the International Ski Federation's rules
                <cite title="Overview of the NCAA Playing Rules Process">(What is a playing rule?,
                    n.d.)</cite>. As a result, there is minimal difference between intercollegiate and open
                competitions. Athletes in these sports produce the same times or scores irrespective
                of the competition being an open event or an intercollegiate event. By competing within open
                competitions, collegiate programs can enter more
                local events minimizing the expense of operating a program while still providing athletic
                opportunities to athletes.
            </p>

            <p>Though this blending of collegiate and non-collegiate competitors raised regulatory concerns for the
                NCAA,
                including questions about the eligibility of student-athletes. The NCAA prohibits athletes, during
                the season, from
                competing on teams outside of their institution, except when participating for an Olympic or
                National Team <cite title="NCAA Division I Manual">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,
                    2021d)</cite>.
                However, athletes engaging in personal activities has been viewed differently than engaging in team
                competition. The wide range of levels of individual competition in open events, from local charity
                fun-runs to
                events featuring Olympians, made it challenging to create consistent standards for member
                institutions and student-athletes. To minimize the regulatory burden of reviewing each possible
                event a student-athlete may want to enter and because individual athlete participation in open
                events was not considered an impact on collegiate competition, the NCAA took a hands-off approach and
                implemented the <i>unattached individual athlete provision</i> (codified in rule 17.33.1.8)</p>

                        student-athlete's sport, as long as the
                        student-athlete represents only the student-athlete in the competition and does not engage
                        in such competition as a member

            <p>In collegiate wrestling, the use of unattached athletes is more prevalent than in any other sport,
                despite a high attrition rate of athletes not completing their athletic eligibility <cite
                    title="Why Redshirt?">(Levendusky, 2021)</cite>. This practice has a significant impact
                on student-athletes. Not only do student-athletes have to bear the expenses themselves, but they are
                also not
                allowed to receive coaching from their college coaches, and open tournament structures require a
                considerable time commitment <cite

            <p>Financial concerns are a significant stressor for student-athletes, ranking third according to an
                NCAA survey <cite title="NCAA Student-Athlete Well-Being Study (Fall 2021)">(NCAA Research,
                    2022)</cite>. This burden is felt even more acutely by first-generation students, who report
                nearly double the stress levels regarding their ability to pay for their education compared to their
                peers <cite title="First-Generation Students' Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic.">(Soria et
                    al.,
                    2020)</cite>. Furthermore, a study on collegiate financial wellness found that first-generation
                students are less equipped to manage their finances <cite
                    title="Financial Experiences Among First-Generation College Students.">(Study on Collegiate
                    Financial Wellness, 2020)</cite>.</p>

            <p>The financial burden of participating in wrestling can be substantial due to the limited scholarship
                support for non-headcount sports <cite
                    title=" November 10). <cite>Defining Head Count and Equivalency Sports">(Kruhm, 2021)</cite>.
                Despite this, there is a widespread expectation that athletes will compete unattached, which one
                head coach estimated would cost an athlete an extra $900 per season <cite
                    title="Wrestling: an inside look at competing 'unattached' as an Ohio State wrestler.">(Helfrich,
                    2017)</cite>.</p>

            <p>Unattached competition in collegiate wrestling not only places a financial burden on athletes but
                also extends to their time commitment. Due to the structure of unattached competitions, athletes
                only compete in tournament events, which can lead to prolonged competition days, further exacerbated
                by the need for carpooling and waiting for their group's final athlete to finish before leaving.
                Even though most competitions on intercollegiate schedules are single dual meets, wrestling has the
                second-highest average time commitment per competition day among all NCAA sports. This time burden
                is particularly onerous for unattached athletes, who are subjected to an even greater time
                commitment than the average collegiate wrestler.</p>

            <p>Athletic activity can negatively impact academic performance as athletes may spend more time on their
                sport than they realize. According to <cite title="Study probes time allotments.">Paskus
                    (2008)</cite>, athletes may experience a decrease in the time they dedicate to their academics
                when they increase their athletic activity. In addition, athletes may underestimate the amount of
                time they allocate to their sport during the season. For example, a study conducted by <cite
                    title="The 20-hour rule: student-athletes time commitment to athletics and academics.">Ayers et
                    al. (2012)</cite> found that while athletes reported spending an average of 21.5 hours a week on
                their sport in-season, their actual time spent on the sport was 31.14 hours per week.</p>

            <p>Unattached competition also presents challenges for athletes, beyond just the financial expenses.
                Coaches are not allowed to provide coaching to athletes competing unattached, and the competition
                schedule is often drastically different from the program's posted schedule. This lack of support can
                put unattached athletes at a disadvantage in their training cycles, as their training may not be
                optimized for their competition. This lack of focus from the coaching staff can contribute to the
                high attrition rate and exacerbate the pressures of adjusting to college life <cite title="Pre- to Post-Season Changes in the Intrinsic Motivation of First Year
                            College Athletes: Relationships with Coaching Behavior and Scholarship Status.">(Amorose &
                    Horn, 2001)</cite>.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the unattached athlete provision in collegiate wrestling is no longer relevant in the
                current framework. The original idea behind this provision was that open competitors, even if they
                were collegiate athletes competing individually, would not have any impact on the collegiate season
                and therefore did not require regulation from the association. This notion has since become
                obsolete.</p>

            <!--<p>Currently, the provision has become an indispensable component of collegiate wrestling, allowing
                    non-collegiate and collegiate rostered competitors to participate in the same events. As a result,
                    unattached competitors have a direct impact on the Division I collegiate season.</p>
                -->
            <p>Despite the perception that unattached competition is solely developmental and has little impact on
                an individual's or team's collegiate career, since 2006 an unattached match may count retroactively
                if a redshirt
                is pulled <cite title="Wrestling Rules Book, 2005-06.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,
                    2006)</cite>. Thus, each unattached competition could have the same significance as an official
                collegiate competition. Consequently, athletes and coaches are aware of this, making unattached
                competition, in effect, no longer a developmental exhibition but an actual collegiate competition,
                further
                burdening unattached athletes.</p>

            <p>Unattached athletes compete directly with collegiate athletes and can influence the outcome of
                matches and national tournament qualifications. The Division I qualification system considers
                unattached competitors as intercollegiate competition, and the results against these competitors are
                included in the calculation of RPIs. This factor affects not only the athletes who enter open
                competitions but also their opponents who do not compete in any open competitions throughout the
                season. The inconsistent results from unattached competitors, caused by the lack of support, raise
                concerns about the reliability of win percentages and RPIs for qualification purposes <cite
                    title="2021-22 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships Selection Criteria Grid.">(National
                    Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d. -am)</cite>.</p>

            <p>The challenges faced by unattached athletes are well-known within the sport, with coaches frequently
                discussing the issues surrounding their participation. However, despite these challenges, coaches appear
                unwilling to encourage the burning of a season of eligibility to gain the full benefits of collegiate
                athletic participation <cite title="What will it take for NCAA to change wrestling rule?">(Hamilton,
                    2015)</cite>. It has become standard practice to expect student-athletes to endure these burdens to
                benefit the program should the student-athlete remain a member of the program in five-years time.</p>

            <!-- <p>While the NCAA has adopted a hands-off approach to the provision for unattached athletes. This approach
                has been eroded, particularly in wrestling, where issues frequently arise due to the provision's
                widespread use.</p>
-->
            <p>Despite open (unattached) competition being viewed as competition outside the NCAA's purview, NCAA
                wrestling
                has increasingly adopted an authoritative position over rostered athletes competing as individuals, even
                when unattached. The sport has dictated provisions around weight classes, restricted the timing of
                competitions <cite title="NCAA Manual 17.33.1.8.1 Exception. Wrestling.">(17.33.1.8.1)</cite>, and even
                brought unattached competition under the NCAA's purview for the purpose of enforcing administrative
                violations upon wrestlers <cite title="NCAA Manual 17.33.1.8.1 Exception. Wrestling.">(Wrestling
                    Rule 8.4.)</cite>. This has increased the administrative burden required to operate a wrestling
                program.</p>
            <p>Unlike other NCAA individual sports which follow the rules and recommendations of a national sport body,
                wrestling has its own rulesbook and rules committee, which changes the paradigm of open competition for
                wrestling. The
                distinction between open and intercollegiate events may seem subtle, but it is crucial. Within
                wrestling, only events specifically designed for intercollegiate competition use NCAA rules. If an event
                fails to adhere to these standards, it becomes an exhibition for collegiate athletes <cite
                    title="Extra Matches During Dual Meet and Tournament Competition.">(Barbee, 2020)</cite>.</p>

            <p>The primary purpose of open competitions in wrestling is to permit rostered collegiate athletes to
                compete in college competitions while maintaining their eligibility. Permitting non-rostered open
                competitors in these events is largely only done to remain in compliance.</p>


            <p>The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) identified wrestling's widespread
                use of the provision was perverting the rule's intent and after some attempts to regulate
                the provision concluded the administrative burden was too great. They responded by removing the
                unattached athlete provision from their rules book in 2021 <cite
                    title="Unattached Criteria no longer appicible as of May 1, 2021">(NAIA's Interpretation
                    Library, n.d.)</cite>.</p>




            <p>It's likely that the Blue Ribbon Task force understands that any academic issues within the sport are
                the result of the unattached competition provision. This would explain the task force only
                recommending the Division I season be moved despite all divisions going through the same academic
                acclimation
                period and weight certification process. The only significant differences between the divisions is
                that Division I wrestlers are significantly more likely to redshirt and compete unattached their first
                season on campus

                            <p>This creates a dual track postseason whereby, the week of the of the team championship

                                for a team championship or qualifying athletes for the individual championship. A
                                program will never be focused on both team and individual competitions at the same time.

                            <p>The Supplemental Regional Qualifiers are called Supplemental Qualifiers because their

                                resume for direct qualification due to their team's lack of success during the season.

                                or by at-large qualification.</p>
                            <p>All athletes from programs contending for a team title will be considered for at-large
                                qualification. This ensures that the athletes from those eight programs will be
                                considered for selection after all of the Direct Qualifier and Supplemental Qualifiers

                            <p>The objective here is to try to best ensure that all the top-25 athletes, based on their
                                season's body of work, qualify for the individual championship. This makes an athlete's

                                and the only method available for athletes from programs competing for national team
                                titles.</p>

                                        championship and they have the 29th best athlete at a weight class, and that
                                        29th best athlete may not qualify for the individual championship while an

                                        weight qualifies to the individual championship due to placing third in a

                            <p>Yes. That is correct.</p>

                            <p>That dynamic already happens today based on the current qualification process. It's
                                possible for an athlete to stay home today despite having the 29th best season while an
                                athlete with the 35th best season advances to the individual championship.</p>

                            <p>Within this new framework, athletes still competing in the team championship the week of
                                the Supplemental Qualifiers have been provided with a championship experience through
                                the team championship. They have had the sport focused on their team and individual
                                performances and they have had opportunities to improve their atlarge resume through
                                competition with athletes from other quality programs.</p>

                            <p>Athletes from programs competing for the team championship must earn a bid through their
                                season's body of work.</p>

                            <p>Additionally, the Big Ten conference dual schedule is currently completed prior to the
                                postseason which would be when a conference would need to have determined their
                                conference champion if they wished to have an automatic bid to the team championship.
                            </p>

                            <p>All conferences have November, December, January, and February to hold competitions to
                                determine their conference automatic bid. Conferences may set up their own conference
                                scheduling as they would like. It is expected that conferences would award their
                                automatic bid to their conference regular season champion as that would require little,
                                if any, change to teams current schedules.</p>

                            <p>There is nothing in this framework that requires the Big Ten Conference to make any

                                II, the whole postseason for the wrestling shifts while the NCAA basketball

                            When referencing the Blue Ribbon Task Force it is important to note that the Division I
                            coaches were the first to discuss the move to a one semester sport.
                            In addition the report should have also discussed the meeting of the Big Ten Coaches had in
                            the spring of 22 with the Big Ten Network. During that meeting the coaches asked what could
                            drive the viewership higher and in a word the BTN said “move the season”. Also the report
                            should have pointed out that March is the second busiest month for NCAA championships and
                            this report proposes adding another one to the mix. If you look at the various months you
                            will find that April is the second slowest month for NCAA championships. Another great time
                            to capture new and casual fans. (July 5, 2023)

                                only the final
                                proposal
                                and its corresponding considerations have been included within the Cucumber Report. A
                                significant portion of
                                the

                                been omitted.</p>


                            <p>Prior to producing the report, there was an extensive analysis of the proposals,
                                hypotheses,
                                and
                                recommendations circulating within the wrestling community, including those put forth by
                                the esteemed Blue
                                Ribbon Task Force. Multiple options were thoroughly reviewed and evaluated, taking into
                                consideration
                                relevant
                                research and modeling that could provide insights into these proposals.</p>


                            <p>This analysis identified deficiencies in the hypothesis that shifting the NCAA Wrestling
                                Championships
                                to April, or later, would enhance consumer demand and interest in the NCAA Wrestling
                                Championships and/or
                                regular season. While it is true April hosts fewer NCAA Championships compared to March,
                                simply moving the
                                championships to April (or later) does not guarantee an increase in consumption of NCAA
                                Wrestling.</p>

                            <p>In order to maintain the strong interest in the NCAA Individual Wrestling Championships
                                within the expanded
                                structure of a team and individual championship, it is crucial to ensure that the
                                quality of the venue and
                                the
                                competition structure remains enjoyable for what this report identifies as sport
                                loyalists who have been the
                                core regular attendees of the Championship event for years.</p>

                            <p>If the championships were moved to April (or even May), it would likely result in a
                                decrease in the demand
                                for
                                bids to host the championship event, directly impacting the event's profitability.</p>

                            <p>The NCAA Wrestling Championship requires high-quality arenas capable of accommodating
                                15,500 spectators per
                                session, equipped with LED video boards, ribbon boards, media production studios,
                                professionally equipped
                                video
                                control rooms, green rooms, meeting rooms, as well as full-time staffing for all
                                in-house production staff,
                                located within a city with enough hotel rooms to accomodate the influx of attendees
                                (National
                                Collegiate Athletic Association, 2019a). Most of the venues
                                capable of meeting these standards are professional sports arenas with full-time NBA
                                and/or NHL tenants.</p>

                            <p>The duration of the NCAA Individual Wrestling Championships requires the host venue to be
                                allocated for
                                nearly a
                                full week (Monday to Sunday). Thus if the NCAA Wrestling Championships are moved to
                                April, it will be nearly
                                impossible for venues with professional tenants to bid on hosting the Championships as
                                the event's dates are
                                in
                                direct competition with the NBA and NHL playoffs (National Basketball Association, 2023;
                                National Hockey
                                League, 2023). These venues must reserve these playoff dates for their
                                full-time tenants, ensuring facility availability should their primary tenant(s) make
                                the playoffs.</p>

                            <p>This reduction in the number of prospective venues will significantly reduce the number
                                of competitive bids
                                recieved by the Association. Therefore, moving the Championships to April or May would
                                likely result in
                                cities
                                like Des Moines (2013 host), Albany (2002), or Omaha (2010) winning the rights to host
                                the Championships,
                                after
                                cities like Philadelphia (2011), New York (2016), Cleveland (2018), Detroit (2022), and
                                Saint Louis (2021)
                                decline to bid on the Championships.</p>

                            <p>Not only would the net impact likely lead to a reduction in the number of possible
                                attendees due to smaller
                                venues in less desirable locales, but it would also increase expenses for flights and
                                hotels for the
                                association as well as fans adding to a
                                decrease in overall local championship amenities.</p>

                            <p>The impact of such a change is particularly concerning due to the NCAA Wrestling
                                Committee recently reviewing
                                increasing the minimum financial guarantee necessary for hosting the NCAA Individual
                                Championships from $2.5
                                Million to $3 Million (National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2023a). These higher
                                financial guarantees
                                may
                                prove too burdensome for the remaining prospective host municipalities,
                                resulting in a reduction in the financial guarantees for the championships overall.</p>

                            <p>A reduction in financial guarantees would directly impact the Association's investment in
                                the NCAA
                                Wrestling Championship(s) and subsequently lead to a decline in the quality of the event
                                for all
                                stakeholders.</p>

                            <p>While there has been considerable discussion about the NCAA Wrestling Championships
                                competing with the NCAA
                                Men's Basketball Championships for viewers, it's important to recognize that the
                                consumption of
                                intercollegiate
                                sports is driven primarily as an entertainment and leisure activity. As a result,
                                competition is not limited
                                to
                                NCAA Championships or or even sports in general. Competition may come from any
                                alternative entertainment or
                                leisure activity individuals find more preferable, in the moment, than consuming NCAA
                                Championship
                                Wrestling.</p>

                            <p>This means that while moving the Wrestling Championships would avoid the competition with
                                NCAA Men's
                                Basketball
                                Championships, new competition would arise from alternative sports programming such as
                                the NBA playoffs, NHL
                                playoffs, and MLB regular season. Additionally, the most significant competition is
                                likely to come from
                                outdoor
                                activities, spring high school or youth sports, or simply nicer weather and longer days.
                            </p>

                            <p>In March, the prime television-watching season comes to an end, and viewership declines
                                significantly during
                                the spring and summer months (Krantz-Kent, 2018). Research by Barnett et al. (1991) has
                                shown that modeling
                                based on three non-programing based variables, which includes seasonality, can model
                                television viewership
                                with 99% accuracy. If the NCAA Wrestling Championships were moved from March to April,
                                it would shift the
                                event from a period when many people are used to watching televised sports to a time
                                when very few people
                                intend to watch TV.</p>


                            <p>This change is due primarily to the transition in seasons, which leads to more sunshine
                                (longer days) and
                                increased average temperatures. As temperatures rise and days become longer, following
                                the cold and dark
                                winter,
                                television viewership declines at a predictable and measurable rate (Eisinga, Franses, &
                                Vergeer, 2011). The
                                improved weather provides new opportunities for engaging in
                                alternative entertainment activities that feel more novel following the winter months
                                and are valued more
                                highly
                                than watching television at this time of the year.</p>

                            <p>Moreover, people are not only less likely to watch television in April and May but also
                                less likely to be
                                aware
                                of televised events. This is partly due to reduced consumption of television, which
                                provides information on
                                future programming, and would likely be exasperated within wrestling's consumers due to
                                the lack of
                                continuity
                                of the various wrestling competition seasons.</p>

                            <p>Aligning the intercollegiate wrestling season with the youth and high school seasons is
                                crucial for fostering
                                a
                                culture of wrestling consumption. During this time of year, the wrestling community
                                spends more time
                                together,
                                thinking about the sport, and engaging in natural discussions about the sport, including
                                the programming and
                                results of the NCAA Championships.</p>

                            <p>Shifting the intercollegiate seasons and championships to a different time of year, when
                                the majority of high
                                school and wrestling stakeholders have moved on to other activities, would diminish the
                                sport's connection
                                with
                                its target consumers (high school and youth wrestlers, coaches, and their parents). The
                                sport specialization
                                rate within wrestling (~30%) is lower than the typical high school sport specialization
                                rate (Howard, 2016).
                                Even
                                at the high school level, where athletes are most likely to specialize compared to the
                                youth level, there is
                                a high probability that the
                                target consumers will have moved on to other activities and will be spending time
                                outside of the wrestling
                                community.</p>

                            <p>As an example, the Ohio High School Athletic Association's (OHSAA) state wrestling
                                championships, which
                                conclude
                                in mid-March, mark the last high school wrestling championship of the year (Ohio High
                                School Athletic
                                Association, 2023). By moving the NCAA Wrestling
                                Championships to April, every single high school State Championship will have been
                                completed for at least a
                                month, with nearly 50% of high school State Championships concluding over two months
                                prior (Abbott, 2022).
                            </p>

                            <p>Considering that the high school wrestling postseason often runs for a month and the
                                majority of high school
                                (and youth) athletes do not compete in state championships, most of the targeted
                                prospective youth and high
                                school wrestling consumers will have ended their wrestling season three months prior.
                                Moving the
                                Championships
                                away from the high school competition season would reduce the influence that key
                                wrestling stakeholders,
                                such as
                                wrestling coaches and state qualifier athletes, have on other prospective wrestling
                                consumers.</p>

                            <p>In April, the wrestling community would be less concentrated as the majority of those
                                involved in high school
                                and youth wrestling take time off from the sport and move on to other communities. One
                                of the most common
                                communities they transition to is spring sports, with Little League baseball being a
                                prominent example,
                                running
                                from March to May (Coatess, 2023). Consequently, the social influence within the
                                wrestling community, which
                                can serve as a
                                strong motivation for casual sports consumption, would be greatly diminished as the
                                influence of the Little
                                League baseball communities becoming stronger for these individuals.</p>

                            <p>The high school athletes who move on to spring sports, such as baseball, would already be
                                a month into their
                                baseball games when the NCAA Championships are held. Wrestling wouldn't only be
                                competing for attention but
                                actually be in direct competition with actual scheduled athletic events for the
                                prospective consumers.</p>

                            <p>It's essential to note that the improved weather does not only result in a change to the
                                athletic communities
                                people may be within but also result in a change to their social behaviors (Essa et al.,
                                1990). The
                                transition in weather and longer days leads to a
                                change
                                in behaviors, resulting in reduced interest in watching television or attending indoor
                                events (Eisinga,
                                Franses, & Vergeer, 2011l Vachon, 1983).</p>

                            <p>The likelihood of individuals being more engaged with the sport due to the college season
                                no longer facing
                                competition from the youth and high school season is not great. This is already evident
                                within USA
                                Wrestling's
                                senior level competitions, which feature the biggest names in the sport. While these
                                events may not face the
                                competition often cited as a barrier for the consumption of the NCAA Wrestling
                                Championships, consumption
                                remains weak, with wrestling loyalists comprising the base.</p>

                            <p>Consumers are going to be less likely to choose wrestling as an entertainment activity as
                                the event will be
                                taking place indoors at a time when consumers are eager to be able to enjoy outdoor
                                activities.</p>

                            <p>It is worth noting that the Big Ten Network's (BTN) support for shifting the wrestling
                                programming should not
                                be
                                surprising. BTN has limited programing options available in the spring due, in large
                                part, to the majority
                                of
                                the conference's spring inventory of athletic competitions being baseball and softball
                                games (Big Ten,
                                n.a.). These contest,
                                which start six weeks prior to Major League Baseball's opening day (Major League
                                Baseball, 2023), requires
                                the Big Ten's teams to travel
                                to
                                warmer climates for away games throughout February and March in order to be able to play
                                games as there is
                                often
                                snow on the ground still. This results in the conference not being able to capture the
                                media rights for
                                these
                                contests as not being the host (sponsoring) school.</p>

                            <p>For instance, Michigan didn't play their first game in the north until their 15th game of
                                the season,
                                following
                                trips to Arizona, California, and Texas (Michigan Athletics, 2023). Even after that
                                single home game, they
                                traveled back south for
                                another
                                four games in Georgia. Leaving only one out of the first twenty games of the season
                                being available for the
                                Big Ten Network to broadcast.</p>

                            <p>As a result, the network is left with minimal programing options during the spring (Big
                                Ten, n.a. -a).
                                Shifting the wrestling
                                schedule would help load balance the BTN's programing, providing more original content
                                and reducing their
                                reliance on reruns of previous broadcasts (Big Ten Network, 2023). However, this shift
                                does not necessarily
                                guarantee an improvement in
                                the
                                overall reach of wrestling for the Big Ten or other conferences.</p>

                            <p>Though it should be noted, the recent addition of warm climate schools UCLA and USC to
                                the Big Ten Conference
                                will increase the available Big Ten controlled spring sport programing through expanded
                                Women's Gymnastics,
                                Baseball, and Softball, and Beach Volleyball programming for the early spring season
                                (Uggetti, 2022). This
                                programing would
                                simply be new competition for wrestling programming on the BTN if wrestling were to
                                shift the season to
                                April or May.
                            </p>

                            <p>It is important to note that the location of the wrestling championships and postseason
                                on the calendar, when
                                properly aligned, can greatly benefit from the heightened interest in sports television
                                consumption fueled
                                by
                                March Madness.</p>

                            <p>Not every viewership slot in March is filled with NCAA Men's Basketball Championship
                                programing. The NCAA
                                Wrestling Championships being the same month of the Men's Basketball Championship can be
                                a significant asset
                                to
                                wrestling with an expanded Championship structure that features the team championships
                                during the week and
                                between the March Madness basketball tournament. It is possible to align wrestling's
                                championship schedule
                                to
                                benefit from the increased sports viewership that consumers plan for due to March
                                Madness.</p>


                            <p>Harold Hotelling's (1929) pioneering research on spatial competition and location theory
                                has demonstrated
                                the benefits of clustering competing firms, whereby competitors positioning themselves
                                next to one another improves their ability to capture select customers.</p>

                            <p>This phenomenon can be observed in car dealerships, mattress stores, gas stations,
                                restaurants and many other industries, where
                                firms in direct competition with each-other will cluster together (Joffe-Walt &
                                Davidson, 2009).</p>

                            <p>These same benefits apply to media consumption, where being positioned on select
                                distribution networks and/or
                                being positioned alongside high-demand programming can yield better performance for a
                                media property (Ryu et
                                al., 2019). The
                                increasing success of the NCAA Women's Basketball Championships serves as a prime
                                example (Weiner, 2023).
                                The Women's
                                basketball championships have benefited from being positioned alongside the Men's
                                Championship in March,
                                leading to
                                greater consumption of the women's championship than would be experienced if the event
                                was scheduled on its
                                own in April.</p>

                            <p>It's true that wrestling's currently scheduled individual championship date is not
                                optimal. (See calendar
                                below.) Currently, the championship sits in
                                direct competition with the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship's busiest days of
                                competition. Moving away
                                from this saturated date on the calendar is
                                the correct decision, based on the views of this author as well as those on the Blue
                                Ribbon Task Force.
                                However, there is disagreement regarding the magnitude of the move.</p>

                            <p>Moving the Individual Wrestling Championship only one week later, when there is
                                significantly less
                                competition from NCAA Men's Basketball Championship programming, positions the wrestling
                                championship
                                well to capture all the viewers who have planned to spend their weekend watching
                                sports--motivated by the
                                cultural phenomenon of March Madness. While retaining the cohesion of the traditional
                                wrestling season.</p>

                            <p>Not only will the NCAA Wrestling Championship be on ESPN, a major network that is the
                                first stop for
                                consumers sitting down with the intent to view sports, but the programming will also be
                                one of only a limited number of live
                                sports events available on the date due to the inherent nature of tournament structures,
                                whereby the
                                number of contests is reduced by half with each round of the tournament.</p>

                            <p>Just as how there are fewer wrestling matches to watch on Saturday of the Wrestling
                                Championships, providing
                                for more time between sessions. The basketball tournament has significantly fewer games
                                being played the
                                following week for rounds three and four of their tournament. Shifting the NCAA
                                Wrestling Championships one
                                week later greatly reduces the competition with basketball programing and will increase
                                in the wrestling
                                championship's consumption--especially for the Session six finals--which will have very
                                limited competition with the Men's Basketball Championship.

                            <p>In addition to the Wrestling Championships being better positioned as one of the limited
                                number of live
                                sporting events on each of the dates of the event, the Team Wrestling Championships will
                                also be held on a
                                date when there are no
                                NCAA Men's Basketball games due to the postseason structure of men's basketball. The
                                team championship finals will be held the day following the announcement of the Men's
                                Basketball Championship field which means teams will be traveling to their postseason
                                events. It is one of the few days of the year in which no men's college basketball games
                                are played. This will be wrestling's championship date.</p>
                            <p>These changes positions wrestling well to benefit from the increase in televised sports
                                consumption produced
                                by the cultural impact of March Madness.</p>
                            <p>As an example of the benefits of spatial proximity in driving sports programing
                                viewership, we can look to the postseason college
                                football schedule. As there are fewer games on each day, the post season continues
                                to attract fans who
                                have grown accustomed to watching Saturday sports through the fall. This scheduling
                                proximity benefitted the 2022 Celebration
                                Bowl, which drew 2.42 million viewers for the matchup between North Carolina Central
                                University and
                                Jackson State University (Showbuzzdaily, n.d.-a). These are programs which rarely attract
                                rated viewership to their games.</p>

                            <p>This game would not have drawn such strong
                                viewership if it were positioned within a regular season week with many other games
                                going on at the same
                                time. For comparison, in week nine of the college football season, the 7th most watched
                                game of the week was
                                Notre Dame
                                vs Syracuse with 2.34 million viewers (SportsMediaWatch, n.d. -a). The matchup with
                                North Carolina Central and Jackson State outdrew this matchup by being scheduled at a
                                time when consumption is high but programing is low. The same structure which the
                                Cucumber Report is proposing for wrestling.</p>

                            <p>In fact, moving games to April, where there is less competition, did not benefit the 2020
                                FCS Division I Football Championships.
                                Following the Covid-19 impacted fall 2020 football season, with the support of the
                                television networks looking to bolster spring programing, the FCS football championship
                                was rescheduled to the spring of 2021 when there was significantly less sports
                                programming to compete for viewersship. However, the spring Championship was only viewed
                                by 905,000 people (Herder, 2021). A significant decline from the 2.7 million viewers
                                from the previous year's FCS Championship, despite the previous year's championship
                                facing competition from the NFL playoffs and college basketball.</p>

                            <p>While the significance of the game did not change, nor did the popularity of the sport,
                                what changed was the
                                seasonal viewership of television and the seasonal preference of consumers. Fall is
                                largely viewed by many
                                consumers as football season. They associate watching football with the season and the
                                holidays serving as
                                the time for championships. This all changed with the shifting of the FCS Division I
                                football Championship
                                to the spring season, and the consumers did not respond well. While shifting the
                                championship to the spring provided more football at a time of year that football fans
                                don't typically get to watch football. Consumers did not respond. And the same is likely
                                true for wrestling's identity within the winter season.</p>

                            <p>For this reason, wrestling shifting to the spring is likely to experience a decline in engagement with its regular season. While there is competition with high school and youth competitors' own seasons, which can limit their ability to attend collegiate competitions, as previously mentioned, it is precisely because they are in-season and focused on the sport at that moment within the calendar year that there is interest in attending collegiate competitions in the first place. Creating a high-quality championship for wrestling is important, but as Seth Duckworth (2023) has noted, the financial success of the NCAA Wrestling Championship doesn't benefit individual programs. It is important that the structures utilized within the sport don't simply continue to focus on the Championships but work to be a holistic structure that benefits programs of disparate levels of investment and performance.</p>

                            <p>Wrestling needs to be able to measure the impact of any changes made. Simply making
                                changes without
                                performing a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the changes prevents the
                                fine-tuning of the
                                structure.</p>

                            <p>By not making a significant shift to the season, the impact on consumption and engagement
                                for the new
                                structure with a separate team and individual championship can be measured. This is
                                important for any
                                significant change.</p>

                            <p>While the Blue Ribbon Task Force and this author have independently come to the same
                                position regarding a
                                team dual championship, the proposed shift in the season, proposed by the Blue Ribbon
                                Task Force, introduces
                                unnecessary risk. It is vital that there be an evaluation and consideration period for
                                any implemented
                                structure. The adoption of the proposal herein should be done for a four-year period,
                                during which there
                                will be a review of the structure to decide if the implementation shall persist or if
                                the stakeholders wish
                                to revert to the previous structure.</p>

                            <p>When making a change in the season structure at the same time as the competition
                                structure, you introduce
                                many new variables that can impact the metrics which make it impossible to assess performance. Does
                                viewership increase or
                                decline due to the new format or due to the season shift? Does the season shift impact
                                student-athletes
                                positively or negatively, or should that be attributed to the change in the competition
                                structure?</p>

                            <p>The above-stated considerations were among those that led to the Cucumber Report
                                producing an alternative
                                conclusion upon reviewing the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Task Force.</p>
