            <h1>VI. Demand for the Championship</h1>
            <p>To understand the possible impact any changes to the championship structure may have on demand
                it is necessary to first understand the current demand for the championship.</p>


            <h3 id="current">A. Current Demand, Division I Championship Wrestling</h3>
            <p>The current format of the championship utilized for NCAA Division I wrestling
                competition has been successful financially because of strong attendance. And it is due to this
                success that there has been a concern about any
                changes having a negative impact that would diminish the fan experience and result in a decline in
                attendance at the championships <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Jeff Byers: Leave the NCAA Wrestling Championships Alone.">(Byers, 2012)</cite>.</p>
            <p>This may be a valid concern. It's vital that we review and analyze the empirical evidence to best
                understand if
                the demand
                for the wrestling championship is so precarious that any changes would no longer make the championship
                viable.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>While the reported attendance figures for the championship event have been strong, simply looking at
                    the
                    attendance numbers doesn't give a lot of information about the event's spectator demand
                    and thus warrants a deeper dive into how the tickets are allocated for the event.</p>



                <p>The Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa, host for the 2013 NCAA Wrestling Championship, had the
                    lowest capacity of all venues to host the event in the 10 years prior to Covid-19. The venue was
                    close to the minimum seating capacity required by the bid standards <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                </ul>
                <p>This means that the minimum capacity for a session at the championship is 15,500 seats. However, only
                    2,000 of these seats are allocated for the public at large. The majority of all tickets (roughly
                    70%)
                    are
                    reserved for Division I wrestling programs for their fans, administration, as well as the
                    participating athletes and their family
                    members. This allocation process is designed to ensure the key stakeholders of individual Division I
                    programs
                    have access to tickets for the championship.</p>

                <p>As a result of this process, most attendees at the championship are former collegiate
                    wrestlers or coaches, who have attended the championship in prior years <cite
                        data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="Palmer: The Graying of the NCAAs">(Palmer, 2015)</cite>. This system
                    benefits programs by allowing them to ration access to tickets to key members of their
                    program, including donors <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="Wyoming Athletics Urges Fans to Purchase Tickets for Upcoming Wrestling Events.">(Wyoming
                        Athletics, 2010)</cite>. But this allocation system also
                    makes it harder for individuals without a connection to a Division I program to obtain a ticket to
                    the championship.
                    This results in many would be fans getting shut out from experiencing the championship in person.
                </p>

                <p>The seats designated for general admission (13% of tickets) are intended to be a pool of tickets made
                    available to individuals without a connection to any specific program. However, due to the high
                    demand for these tickets, they often go to regular championship attendees, making it difficult for
                    first-time attendees to access them. With tickets sold in six-session packages, requiring a
                    commitment of a minimum of three days, including two workdays, to utilize the tickets, many people
                    interested in experiencing the competition when it comes to their community are reluctant to make
                    such a major investment for their first championship experience.</p>


                <p>While the allocation process has its benefits, it also makes it difficult for
                    individuals without a connection to a Division I program to attend the NCAA Wrestling Championship,
                    even when the event is hosted within their home community. Championship attendance may be more
                    indicative of an attendee's status within the wrestling community than anything else.</p>

                <h3>3. Demand for Attendance</h3>
                <p>The demand for NCAA Championship tickets has long been a topic of debate and speculation, with
                    questions
                    about whether there is excess demand and whether there are significant numbers of individuals who
                    would
                    buy single session tickets but not commit to buying all six sessions. In 2020, a change in venue for
                    the
                    NCAA Wrestling Championship provided an opportunity for a natural experiment to measure demand. The
                    championship was to be held at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, which had a much larger seating
                    capacity than previous venues and also allowed for the sale of individual session tickets. At the
                    time
                    of its cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 40,000 all-session tickets had been sold (<cite
                        data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        title="Bummed that the NCAA championships are canceled? Think of the athletes, like Penn State’s senior wrestlers: Commentary">Carlson,

                    program
                    and host of the championship, the University of Minnesota, had averaged 2,955 fans per home
                    competition,
                    with a peak attendance of 4,025 in the same season <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                        Bryant, 2022)</cite>.</p>

                <p>This natural experiment demonstrates that there is significant demand from individuals to be able to
                    watch Division I wrestling championships far beyond the current championship capacity and that the
                    relative market performance for regular season demand is not indicative of NCAA Championship
                    competition
                    demand.</p>

                <h5>Analysis of Demand</h5>

                <p>Despite concerns that there may not be enough support to sustain both individual and team
                    championships
                    in NCAA Division I wrestling, There is strong demand for NCAA Division I Championship Wrestling and
                    will be enough excitement and support from consumers to support a separate team and individual
                    championship.</p>
                <p>The number of unique
                    viewers of
                    these events is not limited to a core group of supporters who must attend both the individual and
                    team
                    championships for the events to be viable. Should a vacancy arise at the individual championships
                    due to a regular attendee choosing to attend the team
                    championship instead, it is likely that a new spectator will fill the
                    vacancy, increasing the number of unique individuals who get to experience championship competition
                    within a season.</p>

                <h3>B. Sport Consumption, Proxy Sport: Women's Volleyball</h3>
                <p>To understand the expected media impact of collegiate wrestling within a different framework, we
                    needed
                    to find a sport with similar performance metrics to use as a proxy. After conducting an extensive
                    analysis, women's collegiate volleyball was determined to be the best proxy for comparison. Both
                    women's volleyball and wrestling have unique conference-specific media networks and national
                    standing
                    within their respective sports, which allows for a comparison to be made between Big Ten Women's
                    Volleyball and Big Ten Wrestling within a regional and conference context.</p>

                        <h5>National Success</h5>
                        <p>At the last five championships, as of the conclusion of the 2021-22 school year, the Big Ten
                            produced
                            eleven
                            (11) of the twenty (20) teams
                            represented
                            in
                            the National Semi-Final for women's volleyball. In that same time frame, the Big Ten
                            claimed
                            fourteen (14) of the twenty (20) top-four spots at the NCAA Wrestling Championship.</p>
                        <p>Both sports share a similar standing within the Big Ten as they do nationally, making for
                            similar
                            comparisons on the national stage.</p>


                        <h5>On-Campus Attendance</h5>
                        <p>In both wrestling and women's volleyball, the Big Ten Conference is the national leader in
                            attendance.
                            The attendance figures for the conference, for home matches are comparable between the two
                            sports. Each sport is represented by six Big Ten Conference members in the national top-10
                            for average
                            home
                            attendance based on the most recently
                            published data for each sport.</p>

                        <p>The Big Ten Conference's investment into programing for both wrestling and women's volleyball
                            has
                            made
                            it
                            possible to
                            have a relatively large sample size to determine linear television viewership numbers for
                            the
                            Big
                            Ten
                            Network's distribution.</p>


                        <p>The below table shows the instances during the 2021-22 academic year when the Big Ten Network
                            broadcasted team competitions for collegiate wrestling or women's collegiate volleyball live
                            and
                            when the
                            Nielson viewership metrics placed the programing in the top-150 most highly rated programing
                            nationally

                            also able to see that wrestling and women's volleyball draw similar viewership numbers for
                            their

                    <div id="consumption" class="trackIt"></div>
                    <p>There is concern that an increase in the frequency of rematches in sports with fragmented
                        consumption, such as wrestling, could result in diminished consumer demand. To examine how a
                        championship rematch in a sport with comparable consumer demand to wrestling was affected by
                        rematches, we can look at the 2022 NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship when Nebraska and
                        Wisconsin met in the Championship game after playing twice during the regular season. </p>

                    <p>Despite taking place at a neutral site out of state for both programs, the third meeting between
                        these two programs at the NCAA Championship had higher attendance and television viewership than
                        the first two meetings. It's possible that the demand for the championship event as a
                        celebration of collegiate volleyball to conclude the season leads to strong attendance,
                        regardless of the matchups. However, coaches and athletic administrators have also suggested
                        that demand for team championship events increases because the audience expands beyond the
                        sport's loyal followers to include alumni, people with ties to the university, and those in the
                        community where the championship is held who want to attend a niche event.</p>
                    <p>Due to wrestling's change in competition format from the regular season to the postseason, it's
                        not
                        possible to compare the differences between regular season and postseason for team dual
                        competitions.
                        However, we
                        can compare the television viewership metrics of the individual championships for
                        the
                        Big Ten, Big 12, and the NCAA to the team competitions during
                        the regular season.</p>

                    <p>We have observed an increase in viewership for NCAA competitions compared to regular season
                        viewership. However, the Big Ten and Big 12 Championships did not experience a rise in
                        viewership compared to regular season dual team competitions, despite having more teams
                        represented and presumably featuring a better product with more highly rated athletes competing
                        in the conference finals than in the regular season team dual competitions. If viewers were
                        motivated to watch individual athlete competitions, the ratings for the conference championships
                        would be expected to be higher than regular season team dual competitions. However, this is not
                        the case. One-on-one team dual competitions outperformed all non-NCAA intercollegiate wrestling
                        individual championship television ratings. Even the increase in viewership for the NCAA
                        Championships from the regular season competitions is not as significant as expected, given the
                        comparisons to women's volleyball.
                    </p>
                    <p>Increases in meetings between programs, especially over an extended period, help to
                        foster
                        intense rivalries which leads to a greater interest in viewership <cite
                            title="All rivals are not equal: Clarifying misrepresentations and discerning three core properties of rivalry.">(Tyler
                            & Cobbs, 2017)</cite> that will further attract spectators to the sport <cite

                            et al., 2016)</cite>. As a result, having rematches of regular season contests at the
                        championship post season will not diminish the interest in the contests but will increase the
                        interest in the postseason meetings.</p>

                    which
                    are final and definitive." Though they may resemble other more common competitions in every other
                    way
                    they are much more significant in the eyes of the viewers as historic moments for they
                    convey
                    titles of significance that magnify the importance of the competition that is understood by a much
                    wider
                    audience.</p>
                <p>For this reason, it is nearly impossible to derive anticipated demand for a championship from other
                    competitions, such as regular season competitions or even conference championships. Just as observed
                    within the context of women's
                    volleyball where the regular season meetings between Wisconsin and Nebraska were not indicative of
                    the
                    demand to watch their championship match, we cannot look at current regular season competition
                    demand
                    and conclude that the demand will remain static when placed in the context of the NCAA's terminal
                    championship.</p>
                <p>The nature of terminal championships dictates that there is a reasonable expectation for consumer
                    interest and demand to
                    increase whenever the contest is a terminal championship event. This is especially true when the
                    terminal event is a recognizable brand and honor such as the NCAA championship.</p>

                <h3>2. Nation Branding</h3>


                <p>In the realm of sports, researchers have discovered that spectators are drawn to contests where
                    athletes share their national identity <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        title="Factors motivating sports broadcast viewership with fan identification as a mediator.">(Hu
                        & Tang, 2010)</cite>. In fact, <cite title="Sport and nationalism.">Allison (2000)</cite>
                    contends that national identity is the most marketable product in sports, a fact that is underscored
                    by the overwhelming popularity of events like the World Cup and the Olympics.</p>


                <p>While national identity is often thought about within the structure of a nation-state, a nation does
                    not need to exist within a political or legal structure. <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        title="Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism.">Anderson's
                        (1991)</cite> theory of an "imagined community" proposes that a nation is forged through shared
                    experiences and is a socially constructed unit based on shared cultural or historical criteria that
                    exist outside of legal or political structures. Flint's <cite
                        title="Introduction to geopolitics.">(2016)</cite> definition of a nation as a cohesive and
                    coherent unit based on shared cultural or historical criteria similarly emphasizes the socially
                    constructed nature of nations.</p>

                <p>Colleges and universities endeavor to cultivate their brands and cultivate a sense of identity among
                    their institutional communities. Sports are an effective tool used to brand institutions and develop
                    their community <cite title="The Game of Life: College Sports and Educational Value.">(Shulman &
                        Bowen, 2001)</cite>. According to Kevin Knowlton, the Athletic Director at the University of
                    California, Berkeley, integrating athletics into the campus is pivotal in "building affinity and
                    really building community" <cite
                        title="New athletics director: Sports are the 'front porch' of UC Berkeley.">(Kane,
                        2018)</cite>. Similarly, Scott Barnes, Athletic Director at Oregon State University, asserts
                    that athletics function as the university's front porch, being the most visible aspect of the
                    institution <cite title="As Costs of Sports Rise, Students Balk at Fees.">(Longman, 2009)</cite>.
                </p>

                <p>By encouraging individuals to identify primarily within the context of their school's community,
                    colleges and universities foster a lifelong attachment to the institution which creates a nation,
                    where returning to campus is viewed as a pilgrimage and homecoming <cite
                        title="An Annual Pilgrimage to Alma Mater.">(Piccini & De Lisle, 2019)</cite>.</p>

                <p>Many institutions now brand their alumni and supporters as members of their nation with their campus
                    being their geographic homeland.</p>

                <p>With it's individual-centric postseason, intercollegiate wrestling is missing out on a powerful
                    consumer base composed of these institutional nations and the communities they create. When schools
                    participate in team competition, especially postseason competition, it draws in
                    individuals connected to the participating schools, making them consumers of the sport as they
                    support their specific schools in the context of championships <cite title="Motives and points of
    attachment: Fans versus spectators in intercollegiate athletics.">(Trail et al., 2003)</cite>. These communities of
                    supporters and rivals increase demand for championship team competitions by allowing the consumers
                    to feel vested in the competition without requiring the consumer to know the individual competitors

                        title="The natural life cycle of sports fans.">(Tamir, 2020)</cite>, team identity remains
                    relatively constant within intercollegiate sports, regardless of team success <cite

                    beyond the context of a specific sport or one team's performance. The more individuals share, such
                    as being an alumna of a school and enjoy watching students from the school compete in
                    other sports, the stronger the

                <p>Traditionally, alumni associations have been hesitant to promote events that require a three-day
                    commitment
                    to watch only a handful of competitors from the institution. However, with a team competition
                    featuring the institution, alumni associations are much more likely to market to their base,
                    increasing support and affinity for their institution and by extension the sport of wrestling. This
                    is especially true when the event is available to be viewed on television which provides for
                    more passive engagement of the sport making the sport more accessible to consumers without requiring

                    as many alumni to New York City and Washington, DC, as it does to Raleigh, North Carolina, while the
                    University of Iowa sends one in six graduates to the Chicago metro area, double the rate at which

                <p>Wrestling programs can take advantage by tapping into the inherent fanbase within their nation, a

                <p>The underrepresentation of women as wrestling consumers can be attributed to the misalignment with

                <p>The unwavering loyalty exhibited by women towards their favored team makes them a highly significant
                    consumer group for sports. Regardless of athletic performance, they will consistently support and

                <p>
                    The main factor that motivates attendance at sporting events is the level of interest in the team

                    sports marketers.
                </p>

                <p>However, the omission of women as consumers of wrestling could have significant implications beyond
                    their immediate involvement. For instance, women play a crucial role in bridging networks of
                    disparate groups
                    and generations <cite
                        title="Independence Through Social Networks: Bridging Potential Among Older Women and Men.">(Cornwell,
                        2011)</cite>. This point is further supported by research from <cite

                        & Read (2012)</cite>, who found that having a daughter significantly improves the likelihood of
                    interaction between elderly parents, their children, and other relatives. According to Mark Waller,
                    former chief marketing officer
                    for the NFL, women are the
                    driver of decisions within households and were responsible for creating the conditions to make
                    football a family tradition <cite title="NFL Hones Its Message for Its Female Fans.">(Kitroeff,
                        2013)</cite>. </p>

                <p>Research suggests individuals who are married or have children tend to exhibit a stronger
                    attachment to their preferred team compared to those who are single <cite title="College sports fans:
                    Examination of attachment, feelings, and bragging rights.">(Bickle & Burnsed, 2018)</cite>. This
                    information suggests that university students, who are often single and not yet parents, may be an
                    ideal target consumer for intercollegiate wrestling, as they are already on campus where contests
                    are held, and have a low cost of acquisition compared to prospects who are away from campus. At this
                    stage of their lives, university students are more likely to establish an attachment to their
                    school's wrestling program, and this connection is more likely to endure in the long term.</p>

                <p>Interestingly, gender plays a significant role in how family obligations affect an individual's
                    sports consumption. Men often experience a decrease in their sports consumption as their family
                    responsibilities increase. On the other hand, women tend to experience an increase in their sports
                    consumption, particularly in terms of attending live sporting events, after becoming parents <cite
                        title="U.S. Women's Sport Consumption and Self-Identified Fandom: An Exploration of Social Structural and Sociocultural Antecedents.">(Sutton
                        and Knoester, 2022)</cite>. This is especially true for women who were already consumers of
                    sports prior to having children <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Female Sports Fandom, insights from the growing female
        market.">(Newland & Hayduk, n.d.)</cite>. While sports fandom is passed down from parents to their children,
                    mothers can have an even greater impact on fandom by their nature to cultivate attendance and
                    loyalty <cite title="The natural life cycle of sports fans.">(Tamir, 2020)</cite>. </p>

                <p>As a result, women act as a multiplier for generational support for a team driving attendance in both
                    the short term and the long term.</p>





                <p>To attract and engage women consumers, the sport must place an emphasis on teams and create
                    competition environments that are social and engaging <cite

                        & Chiu, 2016)</cite>. It is
                    important to note this tailoring to be more inclusive of women will not exclude the dependable core

                    engagement. However, the tailoring for women does better align with the process of cultivating a

                <p>The progressive format of the team advancement tournament in the NCAA Wrestling Championship creates
                    a snowball effect, attracting increasing interest with each passing round.</p>

                <p>Each individual team dual competition in the NCAA Wrestling Championship provides an opportunity to
                    engage with the community, drawing on the institutional brand to drive attendance <cite

                        & Arnett, 2012)</cite>. The early round on-campus events serve as marketing opportunities for
                    the
                    sport and subsequent championship events. As fans are drawn to the event, they become familiar with
                    the sport, individual athletes, and programs through the team context.</p>

                <p>The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament was not always the cultural phenomenon it is today.
                    In fact, many people were once unaware of its existence. Prior to 1963, the championship game was
                    only
                    broadcast on some regional television stations, often on tape delay during non-peak hours <cite

                <p>In 1979, the NCAA Wrestling tournament drew a total attendance of 62,809, with a daily average of
                    20,936 <cite title="Wrestling Championship History and Records.">(National Collegiate Athletic
                        Association, n.d. - j)</cite>. While the exact number of sessions is unknown, assuming six
                    sessions, the attendance per session would have been 10,468, comparable to the Men's Basketball
                    Championship average attendance of 11,914 across 22 sessions in the same year <cite

                <p>It wasn't until the launch of ESPN which picked up the early round Men's Basketball Championship
                    games in 1980 that the tournament
                    experienced significant growth in popularity <cite title="March Went Mad Gradually and Inadvertently
                    ">(Walker, n.d.)</cite>. ESPN enhanced media coverage for the early rounds of the tournament,
                    leading to greater visibility for teams. Additionally, they introduced the "Selection Show" in 1982,
                    a widely appreciated segment that acknowledged teams for their achievements. This enabled fans to
                    observe and support the regional teams they already knew and enjoyed, while also developing an
                    interest in other programs and their athletes <cite

                <p>The nature of dual meet team competitions, which provides programs the opportunity to utilize
                    various line-ups of athletes throughout the team-advancement tournament, increases spectators'
                    exposure to more athletes within the program and in doing so increases fan affinity to the program

                <p>In addition to their favorite team, fans' exposure to athletes and teams during the tournament can
                    leave a lasting impact. Notably, fans often continue to follow the success and advancements of
                    standout athletes from rival programs in future competitions, particularly if they made a memorable
                    impression in their previous performances <cite

                        Schmidt & Torgler, 2014b)</cite>. In most NCAA team-advancement championships, fans of the
                    losing team typically become interested in tracking the progress of the team and athletes that
                    defeated them throughout the championship. However, wrestling stands apart by introducing a separate
                    individual championship. This unique format allows the losing program to generate increased interest
                    in their own student-athletes who have left a lasting impression on event spectators. As these
                    athletes participate in the individual championship, they become more recognizable to the viewers,
                    whether they attended the event in person or watched it on television. This is due to the athletes
                    being previously introduced to fans through team competitions held on dates and at times that did
                    not clash with high school competitions or NCAA men's basketball tournaments. </p>

                    distance themselves in a loss to say, "they lost." It's also why fans are more likely to wear team
                    apparel following a win. This effect is magnified for fans attending the contest
                    at the time of the win which makes a contest location vital for cultivating fan support for a
                    program <cite

                    of winning teams but extends to the physiological benefits as well. In addition to improving their
                    mood and self-esteem, supporters of winning teams experience an increase in their testosterone

                <p>The team competition structure with on-campus team dual meets, creates an atmosphere that increases
                    the opportunity for fan engagement. Fans can connect with the wrestlers and the teams in a
                    more intimate setting, allowing for a deeper emotional investment in the championship event. The
                    break between rounds allows fans to reflect on the successes of the teams and individual wrestlers
                    in those events. This reflection increases fan excitement and investment in the tournament as fans
                    experience the highs of success for a longer period of time. While a subsequent round loss may come,
                    the hope and excitement that fans feel in the time off between rounds continues for a greater period
                    leading to greater satisfaction with the team and a greater vested interest in the success

                        title="The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines.">William
                        Stanley Jevons' (1865)</cite> pioneering research marked the beginning of the exploration into
                    induced demand. He discovered that the more efficient steam engine, which required less coal for
                    production, resulted in an unexpected increase in total coal consumption. This economic phenomenon,
                    whereby enhancements in the efficiency of a technology or resource usage led to a surge in the
                    overall consumption or usage of that resource, is now commonly known as the <i>Jevons Paradox</i>.
                </p>

                <p>Induced demand refers to the phenomenon where increasing the supply of a good or service leads to an
                    increase in demand for that good or service. In other words, when the availability or accessibility
                    of a resource or service increases, people tend to use it more frequently, leading to an overall
                    increase in demand. This can be the result of unidentified latent demand whereby demand is unable to
                    be
                    met due to constraints <cite
                        title="Conceptual Framework for Understanding Latent Demand: Accounting for Unrealized Activities and Travel.">(Clifton
                        & Moura, 2017)</cite>.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing about induced demand is how it can impact markets and industries whereby demand
                    would be expected to be static. This can lead to unexpected results.</p>
                <p>Some examples:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Physician Induced Demand</strong> - When the physician-to-patient ratio increases in
                            markets with fixed medical costs, the expected result would be fewer work hours for
                            physicians due to an oversupply of physicians, resulting in lower demand for their services
                            and, consequently, lower physician incomes. However, research has shown that physicians do
                            not necessarily work fewer hours or earn less money in response to lower demand. Instead,
                            patients will often schedule more appointments with their doctors as the wait times are
                            likely to be lower allowing patients to see their doctors to discuss items that wouldn't
                            have warranted taking the time to try to get an appointment in the past <cite

                            congestion may appear to be a logical solution; however, this practice will often actually
                            increase overall highway travel volume, subsequently leading to further congestion <cite

                            individuals to make more trips or to have commutes that are greater distances requiring them
                            to be on the highways for longer periods of time. This leads to an increase in overall

                <p>Intercollegiate wrestling has been the subject of a growing and contentious debate regarding
                    alternative competition structures, specifically team and individual formats, and which yields the
                    most interest from consumers. While it is widely acknowledged within the wrestling community that
                    the NCAA
                    Championships are "college wrestling's crown jewel" <cite
                        title="50 Facts And Figures From The NCAA Championships.">(Hamilton, 2022)</cite> and "the most
                    fun wrestling event in the world every year" <cite
                        title="‘The Most Fun Wrestling Event in the World,’ Is Also the Best Championship Experience in College Sports">(Hook,
                        2022)</cite>, there has been a fear that adding another NCAA Championship event would dilute
                    interest in wrestling by offering too many events.</p>

                <p>This debate between team and individual formats has likely misunderstood the core motivation
                    for consumer
                    interest in the NCAA Wrestling Championship. The event's success is not predicated on the
                    individual competition format, nor is it due to calculating team standings based on results from
                    athletes competing at the event. These attributes abound at competitions throughout the season
                    without anywhere near the level of consumer interest experienced by the NCAA championships.</p>

                <p>The NCAA championship is successful because it is the NCAA Division I Championship, the event for
                    which all athletes have spent their year training, the championship that all member schools strive
                    to win. Fans, as well as the public, know the significance of the competition thanks to
                    the strength of the NCAA brand.</p>


                <p>The best wrestling takes place at the event specifically because it is the NCAA Division I Wrestling
                    Championships and athletes are committed to succeeding at this event. The spike in interest for the
                    championship, compared to other events, is due to the event being an NCAA Championship and is
                    experienced by all NCAA sports. The NCAA
                    branding is universally known and accepted as a significant competition that determines historic
                    accomplishments for teams and athletes which will live on in the record books.</p>

                <p>The decoupling of the NCAA Wrestling Team Championship, to be held on a separate date and at a
                    different location than the NCAA Individual Wrestling Championships, will not change the
                    significance of the honors the NCAA bestows. The same team crown will be awarded to a team and ten
                    individuals will continue to be recognized for winning their weight division at the NCAA wrestling
                    championships.</p>
                <p>This expansion of the current event into another event will expand viewership and
                    attendance based on the same principles we observe within these other examples of induced demand.
                    This theory suggests that by creating an additional
                    event with the same qualities that consumers desire and reducing the burden of attending this event,
                    there will be an increase in total demand to attend NCAA Wrestling Championship events.</p>

                <p>The motivation for consumers is specifically due to wrestling taking place within the context of an
                    NCAA Championship. As a result, expanding the NCAA Championships will not dilute the consumer base
                    for NCAA Championship wrestling but will induce demand. Just as expanding a highway lowers the cost
                    (in time) to travel a distance and induces more traffic, the expansion of the NCAA Championship will
                    lower the cost for consumers to be able to attend an NCAA Wrestling Championship event by having
                    more events in more diverse locations. Bringing the NCAA championships to more prospective
                    consumers, which will increase overall consumer interest in
                    championship wrestling by lowering the cost to the consumer (in time, money, and hassle) to
                    attend NCAA Wrestling Championship competition in person.</p>


                <p>The introduction to NCAA Championship wrestling serves as the gateway to interest in college
                    wrestling as a whole. It is through these events that consumers become educated on the sport, its
                    individuals, the pageantry, and witness the historic storylines that have engrossed wrestling
                    loyalists and made them vested in the results of competitions throughout the season.</p>

                <p>However, the current form of the NCAA Wrestling Championship cannot accommodate the consumer demand
                    for in-person attendance while maintaining the high level of service for attendees that makes the
                    event so successful <cite
                        title="An empirical analysis of gender differences in sports attendance motives.">(Hall &
                        O'Mahony, 2006)</cite>. The only way to grow the event and increase personal engagement is
                    through horizontal scaling of the Championship to serve more consumers through a distributive
                    championship model by breaking out the individual components of the current championship event <cite
                        title="Cloud Architecture Patterns: Using Microsoft Azure.">(Wilder, 2012)</cite>. </p>

                <p>Instead of the significance of the NCAA championships being limited to three consecutive days of
                    competition, mostly during the workday, NCAA Championship competition will take place over the
                    course of a month. This increase in NCAA Championship competition, aided by expanded media coverage
                    and a competition schedule that reduces conflicts with other NCAA Championship events, will provide
                    greater engagement and education while maintaining the significance of the NCAA Championship.</p>
                <p>The NCAA Championships will remain the crown jewel of wrestling with consumers remaining eager to
                    attend. We have witnessed the excessive demand for major events where traditional indoor arenas are
                    unable to accommodate the crowds, such as the cancelled 2020 NCAA Championships in Minnesota, which
                    experienced "soaring" demand <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    compete within postseason competition. As a result, one athlete is given the opportunity to compete
                    for an
                    individual conference championship, team conference championship, individual national championship,
                    and team national championship.</p>
                <p>The new structure not only allows different athletes to compete at different postseason competitions
                    by decoupling these events but also provides an opportunity for multiple athletes to compete within
                    the same
                    championship segments.</p>
                <p>For instance, a program could choose to have a different athlete compete in the 157 lbs. weight
                    classification in each round of the NCAA Wrestling (Team) Championship on their way to a National
                    Championship with each athlete contributing to the team's national championship performance. Or a
                    conference could choose to permit multiple athletes to compete for each school within the same
                    weight classification at the conference championships.</p>
                <p>This pathway to additional opportunities for student-athletes, which is more inclusive of the
                    program's roster improves the student-athlete experience. This can have a significant impact for
                    programs over the longterm as this can aid in retention of athletes but also a positive
                    undergraduate
                    experience improves the likellihood of financial donations to programs in the future <cite

            <p>To best serve the sport as well as the member schools, it is important to maximize the value of
                all
                championship properties. This will provide an avenue for continued investment within the sport.</p>

                <h3>1. Conference Championship Properties</h3>
                <p>The new competition and championship structure ensures that conferences retain complete control over
                    their conferences and their championship properties. Conferences will continue to have the option to
                    use
                    the conference championship exemption <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="2021-22 NCAA Division I Manual">(17.28.5.3a)</cite> to conduct a conference championship
                    for
                    wrestling without needing to count a date of competition on their schedule.</p>
                <p>The only significant change to the conference would be the timing of the event. If a conference
                    desires the matches to count towards qualification for individual athletes, the championship must
                    now be
                    held at any point in the season prior to the conclusion of the regular season. Under the current
                    qualification system, conferences are mandated to hold their conference championships, if used for
                    qualification, after the close of the regular season, post pre-allocation bid announcements and
                    before
                    the scheduled announcement of at-large bids. This new structure offers more scheduling flexibility
                    for
                    conferences. Though in practice, many conferences may opt to schedule the championship as the final
                    event for the final weekend of the regular season, as is common in other individual sports, there is
                    no requirement for them to do so.</p>
                <p>With the change in individual athlete qualification processes, the conference championships may
                    become
                    more valuable for conferences as the events will no longer be limited based on the NCAA's dictated
                    qualification requirements. This means that the conference membership will no longer be restricted
                    to
                    one athlete per weight class. With conferences having the option to increase representation at their
                    conference championships.</p>
                <p>Conferences that elect to permit multiple entries into their conference championship may enhance the
                    value of the championship while offering increased
                    opportunities for athletes within member programs to compete in championship environments and stay
                    engaged throughout the season, ultimately enhancing the student-athlete experience.</p>

                <h3>2. NCAA Championship Properties</h3>


                <p>The NCAA, with over 100 years of experience in overseeing collegiate sports, is renowned for its
                    ability
                    to run championship events that are both competitive and enjoyable for athletes and fans. This
                    reputation has made the NCAA wrestling championship the premier domestic wrestling event, with the
                    association's significant investments in the championships contributing to this success.</p>

                <p>The prestige of the NCAA championships has created excitement among fans, raising the profile of the
                    association's championships. The changes to the NCAA championship properties will result in a
                    significant increase in the quantity and value of the wrestling championship. These changes will be
                    a
                    net addition to wrestling and will not require the elimination of any events from the season's
                    schedule.
                </p>

                <p>The increased value of the wrestling championship as a stand-alone property will be beneficial for
                    media
                    partners, as it will allow for a better return on investment when marketing the championships. It
                    will
                    also provide media partners with an alternative sport for consumers not interested in basketball
                    competitions.</p>

                <p>According to Desser Sports Media, Inc, in the Media & Sponsorship Addendum of the NCAA External
                    Gender
                    Equity Review <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                        LLP,
                        2021c)</cite>, the practice of bundling of media rights for NCAA championship has resulted in
                    only one media partner being capable of serving all championships, leading to a lack of competitive
                    bids, and resulting in the
                    media partner
                    underinvesting in the assets.</p>

                <p>When the current media rights deal for the "Other Championships," a package of 28 NCAA
                    Championships, concludes in 2024, it is expected that
                    at least some championships will be split into other media packages. Women's basketball, as the most
                    valuable property within the current "Other Championships" package, is the most
                    likely asset to have a different distribution partner in the future <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        title="NCAA External Gender Equity Review, Media & Sponsorship Addendum">(Kaplan Hecker & Fink
                        LLP,
                        2021c)</cite>. This presents a great opportunity for wrestling, as ESPN is likely to remain the
                    best-positioned distribution partner for the NCAA Wrestling Championship properties and many of the
                    remaining properties in the "Other Championships" package. Wrestling could become the flagship
                    championship on ESPN for winter collegiate sports.</p>

                <p>However, the current structure of the NCAA Wrestling Championship, with three consecutive days of
                    competition, does not lend itself to investment from a distribution partner, as the programming is
                    limited. As a result, the event does not warrant an investment from ESPN to advertise the event to
                    its network's viewers. To
                    take advantage of this opportunity, it is imperative that the NCAA's Wrestling Championship property
                    assets and programing be
                    expanded to better serve the network for an extended period on the calendar and be conducted
                    in a manner that will
                    attract consumers to the programming.</p>

                    <p>By using historic NCAA Championship viewership figures, as well as regular season televised team
                        dual meet viewership figures, it's possible to create a conservative modeling of the viewership
                        for the expanded championship event.</p>
                    <p>In this model we use the average viewership from
                        the NCAA Wrestling (Individual) Championships as a baseline to establish an average number of
                        daily wrestling consumers for the NCAA Wrestling (Team) championship. This provides us with an
                        anticipated 300,000 average daily (unique) wrestling consumers as a dependable baseline which is
                        less than half of the peak viewership for the championship finals.</p>
                    <p>The average daily (unique) viewership is then weighted by round which drastically dilutes the
                        consumer base in the earlier rounds of competition when some competitions are more likely to
                        fall to streaming distribution and anticipates a split in viewership between concurrent
                        broadcasts (which is not ideal but possible depending
                        on network scheduling).</p>
                    <p>This conservative modeling
                        leads to an average viewership of only 105,000 viewers per session for the team
                        championship
                        compared to the 314,000 average per session at the individual championship.</p>
