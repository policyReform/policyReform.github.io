        <h1>II. Stakeholder Feedback </h1>

        <p>Reviewing the current competition structures utilized by individual sports is useful for identifying
            commonalities and outliers within the structures but this information does not provide valuable context
            about these structures about their support and acceptance within the sport. It is important to get feedback from
            stakeholders on these structures.</p>

        <p>In an effort to gain insights into the perspectives of the coaches of Division I (or National Collegiate,
            if the sport does not compete in divisions) programs, feedback was solicited through surveys and interviews.</p>

       
        <div id="interviews"></div>
        <h3>A. Interviews</h3>
        <p>Interviews were conducted with coaches from a cross-section of individual sports to gain a further understanding
            of what coaches of individual sports, other than wrestling, felt were strengths and weaknesses in
            their systems.</p>
        <p>These interviews were augmented with interviews from athletic directors at schools ranging in degree of sport
            sponsorship and level of resources allocated to their athletic department to gain different
            perspectives.</p>
        <p>All interviews were conducted on the condition of anonymity and as such will not be cited. A list of
            interviews may be found on the reference page.</p>
        <ul>
            <h3 id="trends">1. Interview Trends</h3>
            <p>As is the case within wrestling, the interviews reflected many different perspectives within each sport
                with many coaches
                within each sport sharing conflicting visions for the sport.</p>
            <p>Below are the most consistent perspectives shared through these interviews.</p>

            <ul>
                <h5 id="interviewSeasonFocus">a. Season Focus</h5>

                <p>The most common theme among all sports was a desire to compete within a team-centric framework. This was a surprising finding, as it was consistent across sports and across programs with varying levels of financial resources within each sport. On the rare occasions when an interview yielded support for an individual-centric framework, it was often from a program competing for NCAA titles. The reasoning behind this preference was that an individual-centric model would better prepare their athletes for professional careers. However, this was not a widespread trend among the top programs in individual sports, and there were even some low-resource programs that held this perspective. There was no apparent difference in structure preference based on the level of resources available to the program, although no formal test was conducted to verify this finding.</p>

                <h5 id="championshipstructure">b. Championship Structure</h5>
                <p>The next most common theme among the interviews was a desire to have an individual championship that is separate from the team championship. Many respondents expressed a preference for having the team and individual championships as two distinct events, with a strong desire for the individual championship to follow the team championship as a stand-alone event. There was a consensus that programs should be able to focus on the team championship first, and then allow their top athletes the opportunity to compete for individual accolades once the team championship has been completed. Many coaches felt strongly that this structure would be most beneficial for their program, as they were concerned that too much focus on individual athletes could come at the expense of the team. These coaches wanted to maintain a team focus, but also wanted to add a small number of individual opportunities to the season. Coaches who wanted to move towards more of an individual focus were typically from sports with few, if any, individual opportunities, and even then, they still wanted to keep the team focus as a priority. This ordering of championship events, with the team championship coming first followed by the individual championships, is supported by collegiate wrestling coaches according to previous research <cite title="Evolving the core product: Stakeholder’s perceptions of
                    the NCAA wrestling season">(Cooper & Weight, 2011)</cite>.</p>

            <div id="surveyframwork"></div>
            <h3>1. Survey Framework</h3>

            <p>The sports chosen for the survey were those identified in the previous
                analysis as sharing similar qualities with wrestling or for which the sport has made recent changes to
                the
                championship structure.</p>
            <p>With the goal to see if sports with similar competition qualities share similar perspectives
                to
                wrestling or if there is a deviation in perspectives. Additionally, sports that have recently altered
                their
                competition structure are included to gain feedback on perspective following changes in
                competition
                structure as these sports have the unique perspective of competing under different frameworks.</p>

            
            <p>As such, coaches of the following sports were surveyed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bowling</li>
                <li>Fencing</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Participants were provided the following definitions to create a uniform understanding of the questions
                asked:

                        out
                        in a national field of athletes from a collection of multiple teams. (Examples: Advancing deep
                        in an

            <h3>3. Survey Findings</h3>

            <p>Wrestling is an outlier among the surveyed sports due to the higher level of support for the individual-centric
                model compared to the other sports.  In contrast, bowling, fencing, and tennis, which do not have individual
                intercollegiate competitions for their athletes during the regular season, still had coaches who
                supported the team-centric model.  This means that these sports only allow athletes to compete as part of
                a team in dual competitions. Fencing also has the added issue of being coed, even though
                some schools only sponsor competition for women.  Despite these limitations, none of these sports, including
                wrestling, had a majority of coaches who said that an individual-centric model would be better for
                providing opportunities to their athletes.  Women's bowling, the most team-centric sport, had unanimous
                (100%) support from respondents for the team-centric structure.</p>

            <p>Sports that use a team-centric championship model have support for their model, while sports that use an
                individual-centric championship model do not have support for their model.  Fencing and wrestling, which
                are the most individual-centric in terms of how their championships are conducted, do not have majority
                support for their current model.  However, both sports still conduct their regular season in the alternative team-centric model, which may explain why they lack support for their current championship model.</p>

            <p>Respondent coaches believe the individual-centric model produces a better representation of the definitive best team, but also believe it's better to use the team-centric model throughout all intercollegiate competition, including the postseason. 
                Many coaches prefer intercollegiate competition to be conducted in a framework in which they acknowledge may result in the best team not winning the championship.  This sentiment was reflected in interviews with coaches and administrators following the
                adoption of the team championship in collegiate golf.  While many coaches still feel that the best team
                does not always win the NCAA Championship, they also believe that the current system is the best one for
                collegiate golf and support the team competition model.  A similar response was also observed in interviews
                with coaches in bowling.  Many coaches prefer longer formats that reward consistency to
                identify the best performing teams and individuals, while the team dual format is more likely to result
                in unexpected upsets. Coaches understand that the best team over the course of the season may not necessarily be
                the team that wins on a particular day within the preferred competition format.</p>

                            Having a stroke play format will identify the best team.”</p>

                            win/loss record... Usually the best teams will rise to the top in a longer format, whereas
                            anyone can beat anyone on any given day.”</p>
