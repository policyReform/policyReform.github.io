        <h1>II. Stakeholder Feedback </h1>

        <p>While reviewing the current competition structures employed by individual sports can be helpful in identifying shared patterns and deviations, such an analysis does not necessarily offer meaningful insights into the level of support and acceptance these structures enjoy within the sport. Therefore, it is crucial to seek feedback directly from stakeholders in order to gain a more complete understanding of the situation.</p>

        <p>To this end, surveys and interviews were conducted with Division I coaches (or National Collegiate coaches, if applicable) to elicit their perspectives and insights. This process was undertaken with the aim of gaining valuable insights into the attitudes and opinions of those with firsthand experience and expertise in the sport.</p>

       
        <div id="interviews"></div>
        <h3>A. Interviews</h3>
        <p>To gain a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of individual sports systems, interviews were conducted with coaches from a diverse array of sports, not limited to wrestling. Moreover, to gain a wider range of perspectives, these interviews were supplemented with input from athletic directors representing schools with varying degrees of sport sponsorship and athletic department resources.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure frank and candid responses, all interviews were conducted anonymously and will not be attributed to any particular individual. A full list of interviewees may be found on the reference page.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <h3 id="trends">1. Interview Trends</h3>
            <p>As is the case within wrestling, the interviews reflected many different perspectives within each sport
                with many coaches
                within each sport sharing conflicting visions for the sport.</p>
            <p>Below are the most consistent perspectives shared through these interviews.</p>

            <ul>
                <h5 id="interviewSeasonFocus">a. Season Focus</h5>

                <p>An unexpected discovery was the overwhelming majority of coaches across all sports expressed a desire to compete within a team-oriented framework. This preference held true even among programs with vastly different levels of financial resources within each sport. Although a few interviews revealed a preference for an individual-centric framework, this perspective, when expressed, was more commonly expressed by programs competing for NCAA titles. These coaches felt that an individual-centric approach would better prepare their athletes for professional careers. However, this viewpoint was not a pervasive trend among top programs in individual sports, and even some low-resource programs shared the individual-centric mindset. Though it appeared the top programs seemed to be more likely than programs with fewer resources to support the individual-centric framework.  It's not clear program resources had any bearing on preference for a particular framework, as no formal testing was conducted to verify this finding.  The majority of programs of all resource levels supported the team-centric framework.</p>

                <h5 id="championshipstructure">b. Championship Structure</h5>

                <p>The desire for a separate individual championship was a recurring theme among the interviewees. Many expressed a strong preference for treating the team and individual championships as two distinct events, with the latter following the former as a stand-alone competition. This sequencing would enable programs to prioritize the team championship while also affording their top athletes an opportunity to compete for individual honors once their team competitions has concluded for the season.</p>
                <p>Coaches who favored this structure believed that it would be most advantageous for their program, as they were concerned that too much emphasis on individual athletes could detract from the team's performance. They acknowledged the value of providing a limited number of individual opportunities throughout the season, while maintaining a primary focus on the team.</p>
                <p>Even those coaches who advocated for a greater individual focus, typically in sports with fewer such opportunities, still recognized the importance of prioritizing the team competition.</p> 
                <p>The idea of holding a team championship before the individual championship is consistent with the views held by collegiate wrestling coaches according to previous research <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Evolving the core product: Stakeholder’s perceptions of the
                    NCAA wrestling season">(Cooper & Weight, 2011)</cite>.</p>

        <p>Survey of individual sport coaches at programs competing at the highest division within NCAA competition.

            <div id="surveyframwork"></div>
            <h3>1. Survey Framework</h3>

            <p>The sports chosen for the survey were those identified in the previous
                analysis as sharing similar qualities with wrestling or for which the sport has made recent changes to
                the
                championship structure.</p>
            <p>With the goal to see if sports with similar competition qualities share similar perspectives
                to
                wrestling or if there is a deviation in perspectives. Additionally, sports that have recently altered
                their
                competition structure are included to gain feedback on perspective following changes in
                competition
                structure as these sports have the unique perspective of competing under different frameworks.</p>

            
            <p>As such, coaches of the following sports were surveyed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bowling</li>
                <li>Fencing</li>

            <br>
            <p>Participants were provided the following definitions to create a uniform understanding of the questions
                asked:

                        in a national field of athletes from a collection of multiple teams. (Examples: Advancing deep
                        in an

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The following eight (8) sentences were provided within each survey and respondents were asked to complete

            <h3>3. Survey Findings</h3>

            <p>Among the surveyed sports, wrestling stands out as an outlier due to the greater level of support for the individual-centric model compared to other sports. Despite not having individual intercollegiate competitions during the regular season, sports like bowling, fencing, and tennis still had coaches who favored the team-centric model. Notably, women's bowling received unanimous (100%) support for the team-centric structure, indicating a strong preference for this framework. It was found that sports with team-centric championship models had support for their model, while those with individual-centric championship models lacked majority support. However, both wrestling and fencing still follow the team-centric model for their regular season, which may explain why they do not have strong support for their current championship model.</p>

            <p>Coaches generally believe that the individual-centric model produces a better representation of the definitive best team, but also recognize the importance of using the team-centric model throughout all intercollegiate competition, including the postseason. Many coaches prefer a framework that acknowledges that the best team may not always win the championship. This was reflected in interviews following the adoption of the team championship in collegiate golf, where coaches and administrators still feel that the best team does not always win the NCAA Championship, but support the current system as the best one for collegiate golf. A similar response was observed in interviews with coaches in bowling, where coaches prefer longer formats that reward consistency to identify the best performing teams and individuals, despite the potential for unexpected upsets in the team dual format. Coaches understand that the best team over the course of the season may not necessarily be the team that wins on a particular day within the preferred competition format.</p>
