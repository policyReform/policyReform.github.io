        <p>In 1749, Benjamin Franklin, wrote in his proposal for the founding of the University of Pennsylvania that the
            students should "be frequently exercised in running, leaping, wrestling and swimming." His proposal even
            included plans for
            a wrestling facility to be on the campus <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="Origin stories: Penn wrestling">(Kantemneni, 2021)</cite>. And while collegiate wrestling became
            commonplace in the centuries that followed, competition was largely confined within the campus as an

        <p>There is some degree of debate about the date of the first intercollegiate competition. There are
            publications that have
            made the claim that the first intercollegiate competition was a dual meet, in 1900, between Yale University and
            the University of Pennsylvania <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="Championship Wrestling.">(Keen et al., 1964)</cite>. Yet, due to a lack of
            documentation of such a contest, the generally cited first intercollegiate dual meet is the March 21, 1903
            contest between Yale University and Columbia University which finished in a 2-2 draw of the four weight
            divisions contested (<cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

        <p>No matter when the first intercollegiate competition was held, it is widely accepted the origins of
            intercollegiate competition stem from the men of one school challenging the men from another school to
            determine the superior wrestling school through a head-to-head team dual meet <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            the East in
            the decade following those first matches with team results being well documented.</p>

        <p>Independently, almost in unison, and likely organically as in the East, intercollegiate competition spread
            through the
            Midwest, led by Cornell College (Iowa) and the University of Wisconsin, Madison <cite

        <p>This popularity of dual meet competitions between schools created a need to
            adopt standardized rules for competition. Columbia, Pennsylvania,
            Princeton, and Yale took the initiative to create standards for wrestling in establishing the
            Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA) as the first association to govern intercollegiate wrestling
            competition. The EIWA's first championship was held in 1905 with each of the four founding schools competing

                1964)</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>Soon after, in 1909, the <i>Western Intercollegiate Gymnastics Association</i>
            (known as the Western Conference which would become the Big Ten Conference) added Fencing and Wrestling to
            its program. With this addition, the Midwest established standardized rules and began sponsoring an annual
            championship in 1913 for schools in the region under the new name of the Western
            Intercollegiate
            Wrestling, Gymnastics and Fencing
            Association. Soon after, each of the charter
            schools of the Big Ten Conference officially began intercollegiate competition

        <p>To this day,
            the Big Ten Conference recognizes conference members who won the Western Intercollegiate
            Wrestling, Gymnastics and Fencing

                data-bs-placement="top" title="Big Ten Wrestling Record Book">(Big Ten Conference, 2006)</cite>. On
            occasion, the Big Ten has elected to recognize
            the team with the best regular season dual meet record against conference foes as the Big Ten Conference
            champion. Such as, in 1922, where Indiana has been recognized as the Big Ten Champion after finishing the
            season with three
            wins and one loss against conference opponents <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                title="2021-22 Wrestling Media Guide.">(Indiana Athletics, 2021)</cite>. It's worth noting that in the
            same year, the Western Intercollegiate Championship was won by Iowa State, a school that was not a member of
            the
            Big Ten Conference <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="Iowa State Wrestling History.">(Iowa State Athletics, 2015)</cite>.</p>

        <p>By 1924, with intercollegiate dual meet competitions held all over the United States, there were five
            regional collegiate wrestling associations (EIWA, Western, Southern Conference, Northwest Intercollegiate,
            and Missouri Valley Conference) each with their own rules and holding their own championship <cite
                data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="The history and development of the rules and techniques of wrestling.">(Sapora, 1940)</cite>.</p>
        <p>This regional divide within the sport, resulted in a need for a national rules committee to create uniform
            standards. The first
            national rules committee was formed in 1927 under the umbrella of the National Collegiate Athletic
            Association <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="An Evaluation of the Improvement of Wrestling Skills and Competency">(Case, 1964)</cite>.
        <p>Following the formation of collegiate wrestling standards by the NCAA, each of the regional associations
            adopted the NCAA's rules <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

                1974)</cite>. This uniformity within the sport made it possible for the first national intercollegiate
            wrestling
            championship to be held by the
            NCAA in 1928. Wrestling was the third sport to have a championship sponsored by the NCAA, which had been
            created
            in 1906 to establish uniform ethical standards within collegiate sports <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                data-bs-placement="top" title="In the Arena: The NCAA's First Century">(Crowley, n.d.)</cite>. These
            early NCAA wrestling championships featured no team scoring. The committee had debated including a
            team
            component and decided against it, to not distract from the purpose of the event which was individual
            competition to establish a "Champion of Champions" at each weight division. The NCAA marketed the first
            event as the "Individual Wrestling Championships" <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="The History of Collegiate Wrestling: A Century of Wrestling Excellence.">(Hammond, 2006)</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>Six years later, the NCAA had officially formalized a team scoring system which was overlayed onto the 1934
            individual championships as to not require any change in the individual competition format, providing an
            avenue for determining a national intercollegiate team champion which
            has remained a part of the championships ever since <cite title="Wrestling Championship History and
                Records.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d. -j)</cite>.</p>
        <p>The regionalized structure of the sport and lack of a national championship event did not prevent schools
            from
            claiming national team titles before the NCAA's creation of a championship. One of, if not the
            first, schools to claim the distinction of national team champion is Penn State University <cite
                title="Championship History">(Penn State Athletics, n.d. -a)</cite>. Penn State has long recognized a
            national intercollegiate wrestling team championship for the 1921 season.</p>
        <p>Following their win of the EIWA Championship in March, Penn State barnstormed the Midwest to face the
            region's top
            programs. Penn State found success against Indiana (32-14), who had recently won the Western Championship
            (<cite title="2021-22 Wrestling Media Guide">Indiana Athletics, 2021;</cite> <cite
                title="Penn State Wrestling 2021-22 Media Guide">Penn State Athletics, n.d. -b</cite>) and knocked
            off
            the previously undefeated Iowa State team, believed to be the strongest in the Midwest, by a score of 28-18
            <cite title="Iowa State Wrestling History">(Iowa State Athletics, 2015)</cite>. Based on the results of
            these two dual meets Penn State claimed their national championship honors.
        </p>
        <p>Despite this championship claim, Amateur Wrestling News does not recognize Penn State as the top collegiate
            program for the 1921 season. That distinction is bestowed on the Naval Academy <cite
                data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="The Oldest Sport: National Champions">(Sayenga,
                1979)</cite>.
            Navy had completed their third consecutive undefeated season and defeated Penn State 19-6 one week prior to
            Penn State's win at the EIWA championship <cite title="2018-19 Navy Wrestling Media Guide">(Navy
                Sports, n.d.)</cite>. However, as was the case with many schools at the time, despite adopting the
            EIWA's rules for wrestling, Navy
            was not a member of any association and thus did not compete at the EIWA championships.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Westerns which hosted an open tournament for colleges in the region, the EIWA only permitted their
            members to compete in their championship. And gaining membership could prove difficult. Penn State was
            admitted to the
            EIWA as the seventh member after eight years of applying for membership <cite

        <p>The intercollegiate competition structure of team dual competitions throughout the season, followed by
            regional and/or national individual competitions using team scoring was the direct result of the
            limitations of the era in which intercollegiate wrestling was founded. This structure has persisted,
            largely unchanged, to this day.</p>

        <ul>
            <section>
                <h5>Bonus and Advancement Points</h5>

                <p>The current scoring system at the NCAA wrestling championships, which includes bonus points,
                    advancement
                    points, and placement points, may not accurately reflect the performance of individual athletes or
                    their
                    teams. Placement points are earned based on the success of an athlete within the context of the
                    event
                    and provide a
                    weighted value representation of the athlete's relative standing against the championship field. Of
                    the
                    points awarded, placement points are the best representation of the performance of the athlete
                    within
                    the
                    context of the individual national championship. Bonus and advancement points, on the other hand,
                    are awarded
                    to a team
                    based
                    on the success of an athlete
                    against a specific individual opponent. These points, unlike placement points, do not provide any
                    useful
                    information about the overall quality of the athlete or team that won or was defeated, yet they
                    are
                    factored into the event's team standings as if they do. And these points can have a significant
                    impact on
                    the
                    event standings. According to <cite title="A Guide to NCAA Wrestling Tournament Scoring.">Lee
                        Cothran
                        (2016)</cite>, "bonus points are where championships are won."</p>


                <p>Bonus points in wrestling competitions are intended to motivate teams and athletes to perform at a
                    higher level, but there is little evidence to suggest that these incentives have this
                    effect. In fact, research suggests that the opposite may be true. According to <cite
                        title="Testing the Theory of Tournaments: An Empirical Analysis of Broiler Production.">Knoeber
                        and Thurman (1994)</cite>, "tournament theory has shown that those who are higher performers
                    will take less risks within a tournament setting due to the high negative cost to them." Within
                    wrestling, a match can end quickly and suddenly by fall, as a result, elite athletes are reluctant
                    to put themselves in positions where they might lose, as doing so could end their chances of winning
                    an individual championship.</p>

                <p>Wrestlers at the championship are primarily focused on achieving their own individual goals, such as
                    becoming a National Champion or All-American. This creates a misalignment of incentives between the
                    individual wrestlers and the teams they represent. The primary motivation for the athlete is to
                    achieve their individual goals and the team championship is secondary or even ancillary.</p>

                <p>The double-elimination format of the NCAA Wrestling tournaments, which requires athletes who lose
                    earlier in the
                    competition to have a longer path with more matches required for placement, also leads to more
                    cautious and reserved competition, as overexerting oneself can risk an athlete's long-term
                    performance in the longer double elimination competition <cite
                        title="Single- and Double-Elimination All-Pay Tournaments.">(Deck & Kimbrough, 2015)</cite>.</p>

                <p>While the use of bonus points may provide more data for comparison and help to distinguish between
                    team performances in the competition, it can also harm most programs within the sport.
                </p>

                <p>This issue is magnified within the context of matches contested on Thursday within the first two
                    sessions of the NCAA Wrestling Championships. A total of 250 wrestlers (75% of the total field) will
                    exit the NCAA
                    championships with one or fewer matches won <cite
                        title="2022 NCAA Wrestling Championship Brackets.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association,
                        n.d.
                        -aj)</cite>. Which means the importance of seeding is heightened for programs with fewer chances
                    to score
                    points
                    for the team race, creating perverse incentives for the regular season. For most programs
                    within the sport, the first day at the championship is their best, and possibly only, chance at
                    scoring
                    any points. </p>




                <p>Each team represented by an individual athlete at the championships will finish with a team score.
                    This
                    score has become a definitive and objective score that signals the program's performance for the
                    season
                    to stakeholders, including administrators. For many programs their season's performance will be
                    judged by these points and the subsequent team standings they produce at the championships.</p>

                <p>For a sport where roughly two-thirds of programs earn fewer than ten points at the championship, each
                    point
                    earned within the first day of competition is significant. And yet, when a team's points are
                    primarily
                    earned from advancement points, as is the case with teams outside of the team race, it is when the
                    team
                    results are the most misleading. This issue is further exacerbated by the imbalance of brackets due
                    to
                    the
                    inclusion of pigtail matches.</p>

                <p>There is a dynamic which is observable at championship after championship in which two athletes
                    in
                    the same weight class end the championship with identical records of one win and two losses. With
                    each
                    athlete's win coming by decision against the very same opponent. And yet, despite both
                    athletes
                    having an otherwise identical result against the same identical athlete, one team is awarded one
                    point while the other team is only awarded half a point.</p>


                <p>No other NCAA sport has a system of calculating team scores which includes advancement points or
                    bonus
                    points like wrestling does. Men's Tennis was the last NCAA sport to use advancement points before
                    eliminating the
                    method of scoring
                    in 1976 <cite title="Division I Men's Tennis Championship Records Book.">(National Collegiate
                        Athletic
                        Association, n.d. -ah)</cite>. </p>
                <p>Within individual sports, the exclusive use of placement points is common for calculating team
                    standings.
                    This system has the benefit of
                    clustering many non-scoring teams together at the bottom of the standings. This
                    clustering provides security for programs as they are surrounded by a high quantity of peer programs
                    who
                    performed, based on the points awarded, at a similar level with no distinctions made between
                    members
                    of the group.</p>
                <p>For example, 51% of all participating teams failed to score a team point at each of the men's and
                    women's
                    2021 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships <cite
                        title="2021 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track & Field Championship Results.">(National Collegiate
                        Athletic Association, n.d. -ai)</cite>, resulting in most of the programs represented at
                    the
                    championship being clustered together. However, within wrestling, the delineation between programs
                    is much more granular due to advancement
                    and
                    bonus points, allowing for further distinctions between the programs near the bottom of the
                    standings.
                </p>

                <p>This distinction between programs outside of the top programs adds no value to the sport. At the 2022
                    NCAA Wrestling Championships, six of the represented teams failed to score any team points and found
                    themselves at the bottom of the team standings <cite
                        title="2022 NCAA Division I Team Scores">(TrackWrestling, n.d. -a)</cite>. Two of these six
                    programs finished
                    the
                    season with records of 9-4 <cite title="2021-22 Wrestling Schedule">(Ohio Athletics, n.d.
                        -a)</cite>
                    and 12-6 <cite title="2021-22 Wrestling Schedule">(Buffalo Athletics, n.d. -a)</cite> in team dual
                    competitions. Despite delivering quality performances throughout the season, these programs appear
                    to have struggled in the postseason, resulting in their placement as one of the worst programs in
                    the country. For these programs, and many others like them, even though they may have a competitive
                    program with competitive athletes, the team scoring system that is overlaid on individual

                <h5>Difficulty in Fan Consumption of Championship Scoring</h5>

                <p>The current format for scoring the team championship in wrestling is confusing for fans and
                    spectators <cite

                    Not only does it differ significantly from the process used throughout the season to evaluate team
                    performance, but the tournament structure makes it difficult for fans to understand their team's
                    standing at any given moment during the championship competition. With many matches taking place
                    simultaneously, it is very difficult
                    for spectators to be able to track
                    the
                    current standings <cite title="A Guide to NCAA Wrestling Tournament Scoring.">(Cothran,
                        2016)</cite>.
                    This is the same issue women's gymnastics faced which prompted reform to their championship
                    structure
                    <cite
                        title="NCAA gymnastics changed its postseason, hoping for its own March Madness moments">(Giambalvo,
                        2019)</cite>. This phenomenon has been described by <cite

                        (2014)</cite> as "a free-for-all tournament with too many protagonists for the layman to sift
                    through."
                </p>

                <p>The NCAA Championships' focus on individual achievement over team scoring is evident in the
                    promotional
                    materials and information provided to educate spectators on the championship event. An excerpt,
                    shown
                    below, glosses over the issue of how team scoring is calculated. In fact, should someone want to
                    understand the scoring, they wouldn't even be able to consult the NCAA Wrestling Rules Book since
                    the NCAA
                    Wrestling Championship has had a waiver in place since 2013 to not apply <cite
                        title="2012 and 2013 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations">NCAA wrestling rule 4.8.7</cite>

                        2017)</cite>.
                    This means that the current tournament scoring used at the NCAA Championship does not follow the
                    NCAA
                    rules, as written, despite the NCAA's Playing Rules supporting documentation stating: "a
                    championship committee is not permitted to alter an NCAA playing rule" and "the playing rules
                    committee is not able to create different rules for championship play or make
                    policy that would affect only championship competition" <cite

                <p>Interestingly, the 1999 NCAA Wrestling Championship, which ended with the team
                    champion winning by two points (100.5 to 98.5), would have resulted in a tie with co-champion teams
                    each
                    earning 98 points under the current scoring system <cite title="The Top 200 Adjusted Team Scores in NCAA Division I Wrestling History.

                        </div>

                        <h6>How does the scoring work?</h6>
                        <p>The scoring in the NCAA Division I wrestling tournament has changed over time. For the first
                            five
                            years of the tournament, a specific team scoring method did not exist. Oklahoma State won
                            the
                            first tournament in 1928 without team scoring because the team had the most individual
                            champions, but the Cowboys then won the first tournament to include team scoring, in 1934,
                            under
                            the same coach that led them to the first title in 1928.</p>

                        <p>Individual scoring also went through a series of changes during the first years of the
                            tournament, but in 1941, the NCAA wrestling committee created a system where point values
                            equated to different moves for individual athletes. Takedowns and reversals resulted in two
                            points while escapes earned an athlete one point. Those with time advantages could also
                            earn
                            points, but stalling penalties were given to those delaying action. Even more changes were
                            made
                            in 1955, as athletes finishing first, second, third and fourth, scored seven, five, three
                            and
                            one point respectively.</p>

                        <p>Today, athletes complete in a seven-minute match and can win in one of three ways. First, an
                            athlete can score more points than their opponent through takedowns (two points), reversals
                            (two
                            points), escapes (one point), riding time (one point) and near falls (two or four points).
                            Two,
                            an athlete can earn a technical fall against their opponent, meaning that they scored more
                            than
                            15 points than the opposing wrestler at any point during a dual. A technical fall ends the
                            bout
                            regardless of how much time remains. The final way to win a wrestling match is by fall,
                            meaning
                            that one wrestler controls another wrestler and puts both of his shoulder blades on the mat
                            for
                            two seconds. Like a technical fall, a fall, or pin, ends the match. If one wrestler has more
                            points than the other, but then is pinned, the wrestler who is pinned always loses.</p>

                <p>The individual-centric format for determining the team champion in wrestling
                    requires a significant
                    investment from spectators attending the event or watching from home. This is because the tournament
                    format used for the wrestling team
                    championship is different from that of other NCAA bracketed individual sports, such as tennis, golf,
                    bowling, and
                    gymnastics, where teams advance through the bracket to determine the team champion. In wrestling,
                    individuals advance through the bracket to determine the team champion, which shifts the focus of
                    the competition from the teams to the individual competitors. To be informed within the individual
                    perspective of wrestling's championship, spectators must be knowledgeable about a multitude of
                    competitors
                    and
                    their respective teams, as well as the dynamics between them. Which is problematic for the sport as
                    attendees of intercollegiate sports
                    have one of two primary points of attachment to competition; they
                    are either attached to the program (school) or the sport <cite
                        title="Motives and points of attachment: Fans versus spectators in intercollegiate athletics.">(Trail
                        et al., 2003)</cite>. As noted by <cite
                        title="An Analysis of Spectator Motives in an Individual Combat Sport: A Study of Mixed Martial Arts Fans.">Kim
                        et al. (2008)</cite>, many spectators of collegiate sports watch competitions despite having no
                    connection to the sport or the individual competitors, rather relying solely on their connection to
                    the institutional brand. However, within collegiate wrestling, where championship competition is
                    individual-centric, we see that those who attend events
                    featuring top-ranked intercollegiate wrestlers tend to be
                    loyalists of the sport <cite
                        title="An “All-Star” initiative: Maximizing consumer interest at premier college wrestling events.">(Cooper,
                        2009b)</cite>.</p>


                <p>To fully enjoy the six consecutive sessions of the NCAA Wrestling championships, spectators
                    must be
                    knowledgeable about the vast field of competitors. This can be challenging for those who are not
                    already loyal fans of the sport. Those who have a primary attachment to a team are less likely to
                    watch the event, leaving the primary spectators to be the sport loyalists who are willing to
                    make a significant investment due to their enjoyment of the sport. The dedication of these die-hard
                    wrestling enthusiasts is exemplified by their willingness to invest their time and money to attend
                    the
                    championships. The sheer joy experienced by those present is unmistakable. This is evidenced by the
                    fact that 48% of attendees traveled more than 500 miles to witness the 2014 championship <cite

                    youth or high school wrestling, which take precedence at different stages in their lives while still
                    providing the wrestling fulfilment they crave as sport loyalists.
                    Although they still identify as wrestling loyalists, they often lack the intimate knowledge
                    of the competitors necessary to fully enjoy the individual-centric NCAA Wrestling Championships as a
                    spectator. Relying solely on this
                    limited pool of supporters creates a vacancy of support for the collegiate programs themselves.</p>


                <p>The issue of insufficient knowledge about competitors has long plagued individual sports. However,
                    this issue
                    is exacerbated within the collegiate model which limits athletes to four years of competition and
                    thus requires a much greater effort to educate the consumer base about the constant changing faces
                    within collegiate wrestling <cite

                    athletes have much longer tenures providing a greater return on investment when marketing
                    individual athletes.</p>

                    individual model's success for combat sports. However, research on UFC programming consumption has
                    revealed that American consumers are most interested in knowing fighters' backgrounds and histories
                    before watching them compete <cite

                    to individuals in a way that cannot be replicated in the collegiate context. UFC's pay-per-view
                    events, which feature the biggest names in the sport, have been criticized for their length and
                    pacing <cite title="It's time to talk about the UFC's pacing problem.">(Fowlkes, 2014)</cite>, but
                    their structure and length is by design. All UFC branded events are extended events that require
                    viewers to tune in
                    early and become familiar with other competitors if they want to ensure they do not miss the
                    headline competitions <cite
                        title="An Average UFC Broadcast: About 6 Hours Long with Only 2 Hours of Fighting.">(Brantner,
                        2018)</cite>. The pace of these events allows the community of consumers to turn the events into
                    social events, further developing the community of consumers around the events <cite
                        title="An Analysis of Motives in Mixed Martial Arts Viewership.">(Kim,
                        2014)</cite>.  The level of social interaction at these events, not the competition itself, is the most accurate indicator of the spectator's intention to return to a future event <cite
                        title="Positioning a brand within the controversial sport of mixed martial arts.">(MacIntosh & Crow, 2011)</cite>.  </p>

                <p>By intentionally limiting the number of competitors in each event, UFC has found the audience becomes
                    more
                    informed about the competitors within the event. If they were to include more competitors, the
                    audience would be overwhelmed by the number of new
                    competitors they are learning about. This approach helps educate consumers about the UFC's newer
                    signed
                    athletes while they are watching the event for the competitors they already know.</p>

                <p>The length of the collegiate season makes it difficult to make the necessary investments to educate
                    consumers.
                    Professional seasons are much longer than collegiate seasons. For example, the Association of Tennis
                    Professionals (ATP) plays an 11-month-long season <cite title="ATP Tour, Tournament Calendar.">(ATP,
                        n.d.)</cite>, while the Professional Golfers Association has no breaks in their calendar <cite
                        title="PGA Tour Schedule 2021-22">(PGA Tour,
                        n.d.)</cite>, and the UFC competes year-round with a major pay-per-view promotion scheduled each
                    month <cite title="Difference Between UFC Fight Night and 'Numbered' UFC Event.">(Way of Martial
                        Arts,
                        2021)</cite>.</p>

                <p>The extended seasons in professional individual sports enables a deeper familiarity with competitors,
                    which is not feasible in the collegiate model where athletes' careers are limited by policy. This
                    leads to a high turnover of athletes in collegiate competitions, while top professional athletes
                    often compete for over a decade, even in combat sports. Consequently, consumers don't need to keep
                    re-educating themselves about the ever-changing field of competitors in professional sports, which
                    is necessary in collegiate wrestling.</p>

                <p>The collegiate model poses a significant barrier to potential consumers in gaining knowledge about
                    individual competitors in the sport. Collegiate competition sees constant turnover of competitors
                    due to the shortened timeline in which they can compete. Thus, the individual-centric model
                    necessitates a far greater investment from collegiate programs than professional individual sports
                    to generate interest in individual competitors.</p>
                <p>Even if campaigns to drive interest in individual competitors within a program were successful, the
                    programs
                    that made these investments to cultivate a following for individuals would be likely to lose these
                    consumers to other entities because of the consumers' attachment being to the individual.</p>
                <p>When these former
                    collegiate competitors move on to other college programs as coaches, become senior-level
                    competitors at international competitions, or become professional athletes in other promotions such
                    as MMA or WWE, the consumers are likely to follow the individuals and not remain consumers of the
                    program. As a result, these programs are not likely to fully realize their investments, and the
                    sport,
                    as well as the programs within it, will continue to rely primarily on a limited number of loyalists
                    as the primary consumer base.</p>
                <p>For these reasons, the success of MMA promotions, or other individual sports, should not be thought
                    of as models to emulate for individual collegiate sports looking to expand and retain their consumer
                    base.</p>

                <h5>Season Continuity</h5>


                <p>The use of two different team competition structures within intercollegiate wrestling, where teams
                    are judged by both the team dual format and the tournament format, has created a complicated system
                    that is confusing for those less familiar with the different competition structures. The complexity
                    of this system makes it difficult for athletic department administrators, many of which have limited
                    previous knowledge of wrestling, to
                    effectively administer the program and hire the right leadership <cite
                        title="Factors Contributing to the Elimination of NCAA Division I Intercollegiate Wrestling Programs">(Fair,
                        2017)</cite>. The unique postseason structure, an outlier within NCAA sports, adds to the
                    complexity
                    of administering the sport, making it more challenging than necessary.</p>

                                uniqueness should be what we do, not necessarily how we do it.”</p>

            <h5>Team Composition</h5>

            <p>According to the <i>NCAA Sports Sponsorship and
                    Participation Rates Report</i> <cite
                    title="NCAA Sports Sponsorship and Participation Rates Report.">(National Collegiate Athletic
                    Association, 2021g)</cite>, the average Division I wrestling program carried a roster of 32
                athletes in the 2021 season. And yet, this structure for
                determining a team championship (and national standing for programs) guarantees that only a minority of
                athletes will ever be able to compete during the postseason, even for those programs competing
                for
                a national team title.</p>
            <p>Since 2014, there have been fewer than three (2.75) programs a year, on average, represented at each
                weight
                class at the championships. </p>
            <center>

                </div>
            </center>
            <br>

            <p>There is a claim made by some within wrestling that programs with limited resources may benefit from a
                scoring system that provides the opportunity for teams to finish high in the team standings
                due to a few athletes reaching All-American or National Champion status. But it's unclear
                if these programs or schools receive any benefits for a higher team placement outside of the
                notoriety that comes from the individual accomplishments of their athletes' success which were the
                direct cause of these team accolades.</p>
            <p>This lack of roster inclusion for programs is a major structural issue within wrestling as any weight
                class
                that is not competitive at the national level is largely irrelevant to a program's national standing
                within wrestling's individual-centric framework.
            </p>
            <p>The current competition structure poses a problem, as programs with limited resources may choose to
                withdraw from one or two weight classes where they have performed below the median Division I athlete.
                This approach likely enhances their national standing and does not put them at a disadvantage during
                postseason competition. By forfeiting these less competitive weights, the program can redirect the
                resources previously used for coaching, travel, equipment, and scholarships to improve the performance
                of the other weight divisions that have a greater impact on the team standings during championship
                events. This strategy allows for a more focused allocation of resources on a smaller subset of athlete
                and an increased chance of success in the program's overall performance while greatly reducing the
                outward appearance of wrestling's viability at the school due to a lack of participation at weight
                divisions within team dual competitions.</p>

            <center>
                <figure>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“When faced with making hard decisions, like eliminating a program due to budget issues, it
                            is easier
                            to eliminate a [individual-centric] sport carried by a few elite athletes.
                            Upset fans
                            point to the success of those few athletes as proof the program should remain, but a few
                            athletes
                            aren't representative of the state of the program. Those few athletes will find other
                            opportunities
                            to compete, and often with even better programs, so fans won't fight the decision in the way
                            you see when everyone a part of the program feels like they contribute to the success
                            will fight.”</p>

            <h5>Program Building</h5>



            <p>The current individual-centric championship model in college wrestling hinders program building. Not only
                does this model mean that there will be few, if any, competitions at the home venue with any postseason
                implications, but it also makes the individuals within the program, rather than the program itself, the
                main vehicle for the program's success. With only one individual being able to carry the program through
                the whole postseason at any weight class, there is a propensity of negative internal dynamics within the
                program <cite title="Whatever it takes to win:
                Rivalry increases unethical behavior.">(Kilduff et al., 2016)</cite> as individual self-interest leads
                to a decline in the cohesion of the program <cite
                    title="Intra-Team Rivalry on Performance Teams: An Investigation into Individual and Team Performance and Employee Deviance.">(Mawritz,
                    2018)</cite> reducing collaboration and leading to a decline in team performance <cite
                    title="Compensation and peer effects in competing sales teams.">(Chan, Li, & Pierce, 2014)</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>Based on the points values at the last five championships, a
                National Champion is twenty (20) to fifty (50) times more valuable to the team's standings at the NCAA
                championships than a
                national qualifier who wins one match. As a result, some coaches and administrators
                believe that focusing
                on attracting and developing a few elite athletes to an All-American level will lead to success for the
                program. While this may lead to a high finish at the national championship, there is no evidence that it
                leads to long-term success for the team or builds a program.</p>


            <p>Becoming a superstar depends not just on ability, but also on sustained success and the accumulation of
                accolades, such as winning a championship <cite
                    title="Rise and fall of stars: Investigating the evolution of star status in professional team sports">(Yang
                    & Shi, 2011)</cite>. The limited eligibility within NCAA competition results in a shorter
                opportunity for programs to benefit from superstar athletes, as they will naturally exhaust their
                eligibility soon after establishing their superstar status <cite
                    title="NCAA External Gender Equity Review, Phase I.">(Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP, 2021-a)</cite>.</p>
                
                    <p>The presence of a superstar athlete with significantly higher levels of talent than the rest of the athletes can have adverse effects on the performance of other teammates during training and competition <cite

                Supporters of historically successful programs tend to value the program's identity as a winner, while
                supporters of unsuccessful programs are more likely to be drawn to the community of supporters

            <p>Intra-squad competitions among evenly-matched student-athletes equally likely to compete in the

                outsized influence, student-athletes will perceive negative events as deterministic. Consequently, the
                already challenging competition for a postseason opportunity becomes even more daunting. This perceived
                influence of luck on competition results may further deter student-athletes, even the most team oriented

                <h5>Lack of Rivalries</h5>

                <p>Rivalries have been an integral part of intercollegiate sports since their inception.
                    Intercollegiate
                    wrestling can trace its founding to men from different schools challenging each other to
                    determine
                    which institution had the superior athletes on the mat <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        data-bs-placement="top" title="Columbia Celebrates College Wrestling Centennial.">(Steinman,
                        2003)</cite>. This focus on rivalries between institutions persisted for many decades, as evident by Franklin & Marshall College prioritizing their
                    long-standing rivalries over the opportunity for individual national championship opportunities in
                    1969 and 1970 <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="Changes in Rules Hinder Wrestlers.">(Gilbert, 1970)</cite>. Their regional rivalries
                    within the EIWA were viewed as more important than
                    any individual awards or honors the NCAA's Collegiate Championship could provide.</p>

                <p>The significance of these rivalries was reaffirmed 44 years later when David L. Lehman, an alumnus of
                    Franklin & Marshall College during the era when the program chose to skip the NCAA tournament to
                    maintain their EIWA rivalries, made the largest ever gift to the school's athletic department,
                    ensuring the endowment of the wrestling program for future generations <cite
                        data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="David Lehman ’68 Donates $5 Million to Endow F&M Wrestling">(Paying His Debts,
                        2014)</cite>.
                    Instead of speaking to aspirations of individual accolades or national honors, Lehman spoke of his
                    experience on a team that finished undefeated in freshmen dual meets and the rivalries the program
                    had in dual meet team competitions, naming the specific regional schools that were important rivals
                    <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                        title="$5 Million Lehman Endowment Gift to Support Wrestling for Generations of Student-Athletes.">(Franklin
                        & Marshall College, 2014)</cite>. Such rivalries serve as the standard for measuring athletic
                    programs,
                    leaving a lasting impact on both individuals and institutions alike. Sports Information Directors
                    work diligently to preserve the records of team dual meets throughout an institution's history for
                    this reason.
                </p>


                <p>While rivalries are not always
                    mutually shared by both sides, they are influenced by a variety of factors such as geography,
                    competitiveness, shared
                    values, historical success, and competition for personnel, including recruits, students, coaches,
                    and fans (<cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                <p>A key aspect of a rivalry is the emotional investment in the results of contests involving a
                    rival, whereby supporters want their rival to fail, even when their preferred team is not involved
                    in

                    mutual respect as a result.
                </p>

                <p>In the past, intra-conference rivalries within collegiate wrestling were fostered by the competition
                    for a limited number of qualification slots available to each conference and the politicking that
                    could take place in their distribution, a dynamic that has changed with the shift towards a
                    qualification system based on the current season's results and an individual's national standing
                    <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="2009 D-I Wrestling Qualifier Allocation Changes.">(NCAA,
                        2009)</cite>. While the new system is better overall, it has reduced the cultivation of
                    intra-conference rivalries, which were once a hallmark of the sport <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        title="OSU likes new format.">(McLaughlin,
                        2009)</cite>.
                </p>

                <p>The consolidation of conferences into larger regional entities has also had an impact on rivalries
                    within the sport as the frequency of head-to-head competitions between conference teams has been
                    reduced. Consequently, the culture
                    between programs has become more collegial as they no longer compete for a finite number of bids
                    based on the conference's historic results.</p>
                <p>These dynamics can make it challenging to cultivate and develop rivalries outside of binary
                    contests between two parties, particularly within the individual-centric team scoring tournament
                    structure employed in college wrestling's postseason events.</p>



                <p>Consider the following scenario: You are an avid supporter of a program competing in the NCAA
                    Wrestling Championships, vying for the coveted NCAA Team Championship title. Over the years, you
                    have had a fierce rivalry with another program, constantly battling for the top spot. However, since
                    none of your athletes are currently competing, you find yourself watching matches featuring other
                    teams. One such match is a consolation match with an athlete from your rival program facing off
                    against an opponent from a team with which you have little familiarity or rivalry. The question
                    arises: whom should you cheer for in this match?</p>

                <p>According to the literature on rivalries, fans want their rival team's athlete to
                    lose, and lose significantly (Wann & Branscombe, 1990; Campbell, Aiken, & Kent, 2004). However, in the
                    postseason competition format used by collegiate wrestling, the situation is not always so black and white. In
                    this scenario, your rival's opponent is from a team that is also in the running for the
                    team championship, along with your preferred program.</p>

                <p>This presents a dilemma. Do you cheer for your rival, hoping that their success will benefit your own
                    program's chances of winning the team championship? Or do you cheer for your rival to lose,
                    potentially risking your own program's chances of winning the team race?</p>

                <p>This dilemma is a common occurrence in the dynamic competition structure of the Division I Wrestling
                    postseason. The conflicting dynamics of the scoring structure diminishes rivalries within the
                    sport, muting team identification for fans. As a result, fans with high team identity are likely to
                    become mere spectators of the competition, without a vested interest in the outcome of much of the
                    competition as their only safe position is to cheer for their team's athletes and against everyone
                    else.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, many other attendees particularly those that are wrestling loyalists, view the
                    competitors as individuals, relatively free from
                    their team affiliations, and support a competitor in a particular matchup based on their interest in
                    the individual(s). For these fans, the team competition
                    is not significant, and they are able to enjoy a broader range of competitions as fans of the sport.
                    Though this approach is only possible for spectators without a vested interest in
                    the team race who possess a deep knowledge of the field of competitors.
                </p>
                <p>The group of attendees who are most likely to thoroughly enjoy the NCAA Wrestling Championships are
                    those who fall into the latter category. These individuals attend the event as true sports
                    enthusiasts, deriving pleasure from each match of the competition. In contrast, those who

                <h5>Decline in Individual Competition</h5>
                <p>While the NCAA Championships are conducted in an individual format, the number of individual
                    competitions
                    on schedules of programs has declined. </p>
                <p>Programs at the top of the sport have greatly reduced the number of matches their athletes,
                    particularly
                    starters, get from individual competitions. The number of individual competitions on these teams'
                    official schedules over the last fifteen years has noticeably declined.</p>

                <p>This precipitous decline in individual competitions is most noticeable for the programs
                    competing for national titles each year.</p>

                <p>The decline in individual wrestling competitions appears to be correlated with an increase in media
                    coverage of the sport. The expansion of video distribution networks, such as FloSports in 2006 <cite
                        title="Catching up with FloSports CEO Mark Floreani">(Jones,
                        2021)</cite> and the Big Ten Network in 2007 <cite
                        title="The Big Ten Conference Announces Media Agreements Increasing National Coverage of Big Ten Sports.">(Big
                        Ten, 2006)</cite>, has made it easier for fans to watch intercollegiate wrestling than ever
                    before.
                </p>
                <p>It is not clear whether this shift is due to these programs and their fans preferring the team dual
                    format
                    for competitions or if there are other factors at play resulting in the shift. But it is worth
                    noting that most individual competitions are hosted by programs with fewer
                    resources (and fewer fans) with very few of these individual competitions using any kind of team
                    scoring.</p>

                <p>This is likely to signal to fans, intended or not, as to the level of significance in the
                    competition
                    format for comparing teams.</p>

                <p>Based on a review of Division-I programs' media guides, sports information departments
                    make a significant effort to maintain meticulous records for all team dual competitions contested,
                    including those with organizations such as McKinley Park YMCA<sup>a</sup>, St. Paul
                    YMCA<sup>b</sup>, Cincinnati YMCA<sup>c</sup>, Camp Lejune<sup>d</sup> and Athletes in
                    Action<sup>e,</sup><sup>f</sup>. These records often go back 100 years. However, records of
                    participation or placement at in-season tournaments are largely absent, even going back just a few
                    years. Only one program<sup>e</sup> was identified capturing their team's in-season tournament
                    results in their historic season records. Though they only mentioned the number of champions at the
                    events. This may accurately reflect the views of these programs, as it seems that while every
                    program documents their team dual's all-time series with each opponent, tournaments are not given
                    the
                    same level of attention. The exception to this is postseason tournaments, such as conference
                    championships and the NCAA tournament, where historic individual and team honors are awarded.</p>

                <p>It will be interesting to observe whether the trend of declining individual competition events
                    continues
                    in the future or if there is a resurgence in the number of individual competitions for the top
                    programs. But that would likely have to mean that the top programs were outliers within the sport as
                    student-athletes and coaches overwhelmingly support more home dual
                    competitions <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

        <h3>C. New Championship Format</h3>
        <p>The format for determining the team championship was created nearly 100 years ago, due in large part to the
            limitations of the time. However, it is now possible to hold a team championship within the dual meet team
            competition structure which has been the primary method of competition within Division-I wrestling for
            nearly 100 years.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the NCAA rules book (Wrestling Rule 3.5.a) defines <i>Team Competition</i> as: "When one
            team
            competes against another team and utilizes the dual meet team score rules." And yet, the NCAA team
            Champion is not decided by the team competition method defined in the rules book.</p>
        <p>The current competition format of Division I wrestling, while effective as an individual championship, is not
            ideal as a team championship in the modern sports era. The structure of the competitive season and the
            championship creates a convoluted sport that leaves much to be desired. To address this issue, the sport
            would benefit from returning to the NCAA tournament's origins as an individual championship <cite
                data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                title="The History of Collegiate Wrestling: A Century of Wrestling Excellence.">(Hammond, 2006)</cite>
            and adopting a simpler structure that is more suited for team competition in the modern era. This will help
            to make the sport more easily understood and administered, as well as improving the student-athlete
            experience while being more appealing to spectators and
            potential fans.</p>

        <p>The team-centric model will foster a sense of program identity and lead to a higher level of buy-in from
            athletes within the program. This creates a stronger foundation for long-term program success by providing a
            sustainable model for program building.</p>
        <p>A postseason structure that provides more opportunities for student-athletes on the roster to participate
            and contribute to the team's success leads to better engagement and helps to build the program. Fans
            with high team identification support the team regardless of the outcomes of the competition <cite
                title="The  influence  of  emotions  on  game  and  service  satisfaction  and behavioral intention in winning and losing situations: Moderating effect of identification with the team.">(Yim
                & Byon, 2018)</cite>. By changing the vehicle for team success to focus on the whole program rather
            than a select group of individuals, the focus shifts to fostering team identification. This change in
            perspective is crucial for cultivating a system of ongoing support from athletes within the program. The
            propensity for negative intra-team rivalries can be mitigated by an emphasis on the team identity as the
            vehicle for success when there is a path for more team members to have an opportunity to directly contribute
            to a team's postseason success <cite
                title="Victimization of high performers: The roles of envy and work group identification.">(Kim & Glomb,
                2014)</cite>.</p>
        <p>
            Elite athletes as alumni are significantly less likely to donate to their alma mater or former team as
            they believe the success they brought to the school was a major gift to the school <cite
                title="An examination of factors impacting athlete alumni donations to their alma mater: a case study of a U.S. university.">(O'Neil
                & Schenke, 2007)</cite>. These athletes understand that they could have represented many different
            institutions and the one they chose to represent benefited from their contributions. This feeling
            is further amplified for athletes when they are significant outliers within their program or when a program
            has elevated the athlete through marketing efforts. Furthermore, these marketing efforts may not be
            effective and in fact hinder long term support for a program <cite
                title="dolizing sport celebrities: A gateway to psychopathology?">(Hyman & Sierra, 2010)</cite>. The
            fans you're likely to attract to the program based on the characteristics of the program are different
            than the devotees of the sport who would be attracted by the campaign.  And since these are the people the who would likely already be aware of
            the athlete, "you're preaching to the choir" <cite
                title="Fans vs. Spectators: An Analysis of Those Who Attend Intercollegiate Football Games.">(Robinson
                et al., 2005)</cite>. A structure which places an emphasis on elite individuals is one
            that is likely to stifle long term support for member programs compared to a structure where the emphasis is
            on the team results and the athlete's engagement within the team structure.</p>

            <p>Note: There are two phases to the scheduling plan. Phase 1 is declared here and based on the current
                season's
                schedule with the locations and dates for the NCAA (Individual) Championships having already been
                determined. Phase 2 follows the same schedule with every postseason date pushed back one week later into
                the
                spring.

            <h5>Benefits of Automatic Qualification</h5>

            <ul>
                <h5>Impact to Conferences and Teams</h5>

                <p>The majority of NCAA Division I wrestling programs compete in conferences that depend on single-sport
                    associate members to meet the minimum number of participating institutions. This puts the sport in a
                    unique position where conference sponsorship and membership is very flexible. There are only two
                    conferences, the Atlantic Coast Conference <cite
                        title="2022 ACC Championships Final Results and NCAA Qualifiers.">(Smith, 2022)</cite> and the
                    Big Ten Conference <cite title="2021-22 Big Ten Wrestling Standings.">(Big Ten Conference, n.d. -
                        a)</cite>, currently sponsoring wrestling as a conference sport without any associate members.
                    Except for the Ivy League, where six member schools compete in the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling
                    Association (EIWA), no other conference has the required six full-member schools sponsoring
                    wrestling <cite title="39 Ivies Earn EIWA Academic Achievement Honors.">(Ivy League, n.d.
                        -b)</cite>.</p>

                <p>For the other wrestling conferences, which make up 76.25% of Division I wrestling programs, the
                    conferences are built around single-sport associate membership. The current conference membership is
                    influenced by a variety of factors, including history, geography, and finances. However, the most
                    significant factor in recent wrestling alignments has likely been the NCAA Championship
                    qualification process. This process has led to conference consolidation as programs seek a greater
                    number of qualifying tournament pre-allocations for their athletes <cite
                        title="MAC Announces Historic Wrestling Expansion.">(Mid-American Conference, 2019)</cite>.</p>

                <p>Any changes in the NCAA Championship qualification process will create new incentives, benefits, and
                    drawbacks for conference membership. This will likely result in many programs reconsidering the
                    value of their current conference membership. Wrestling programs have a unique ability to respond
                    quickly to changes in incentives because their conference affiliation only needs to consider the
                    impact on wrestling and not the impact on the athletic department for programs outside of
                    the ACC and Big Ten. Additionally, these conference relationships have always been understood to be
                    transient, which limits the contractual obligations that would hinder a shift in wrestling
                    conference membership.</p>

                <p>By implementing a system of automatic bids for conference championship-winning wrestling teams,
                    programs will seek to act in their own self-interest. This will likely result in a "right-sizing" of
                    conferences, where most programs hold membership in a conference that they believe is the
                    best fit for their program. The result will probably be more conferences with fewer members,
                    leading to increased parity as the membership shares a similar commitment to resources for their
                    programs.</p>

                <h5>Conference Accolades</h5>
                <p>With more conferences comprised of fewer members each, there will be more opportunities for schools
                    to earn
                    conference
                    championships. Being able to hang a banner is an important accolade within athletic departments
                    <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                        title="Hanging from the rafters, last symbols of success and pride.">(Glier, 2012)</cite>.
                </p>
                <p>Awarding an auto-bids to the NCAA Championship for conference championship winning teams
                    would
                    bring wrestling in-line with most NCAA sports within athletic
                    departments. This would further expedite educating potential fans about wrestling's team
                    championship process. The conference regular season would hold particular significance, not only
                    within the context of their conference but also in the program's ability to participate in the
                    postseason. This ensures that the competitions already hosted at home in front of the local fans
                    will hold particular significance for the program in their postseason ambitions.
                </p>
                <p>Wrestling is not the only sport that has had this issue with a disconnect with qualification for team
                    championships and the conference championship. Cross Country has been working on a reform to make
                    the sport more conference centric to eliminate some of the confusion around their
                    qualification process and bring it in-line with the more universal NCAA processes <cite

                <p>Expanded conference accolades is likely to produce a greater investment into programs. Not only is

                    revenue, which would include a large percentage of wrestling's membership. As a result, any changes
                    which have the added benefit of cultivating an increase in donors is beneficial to wrestling

                    <p>To model possible changes to conference membership over the course of the five
                        or
                        more years following the change in NCAA Wrestling's qualification framework, there have been
                        ten
                        (10)
                        different simulations generated of
                        possible changes to conference membership that could happen as a result of the adoption of
                        the
                        proposal
                        in this report.
                        Some
                        of these are more likely than others and they each, individually, represent different
                        structural,
                        financial,
                        geographic, and political considerations that may impact the decisions that individual
                        schools
                        or
                        conferences make which could impact sponsorship from a conference and the membership within
                        the
                        conference
                        if sponsored.</p>
                    <p>The magnitude and impact of conference shifts will largely depend on which conferences or
                        teams
                        act
                        first and
                        thus which schools and conferences will be reactive to those changes.</p>
                    <p>These simulations only consider the changes in wrestling specific membership and assume that
                        primary
                        conference membership will remain static. While core conference membership will likely
                        change
                        for
                        some schools, these simulations do not contemplate any such changes.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted, there will be four (4) more schools in the modeled future
                        conferences
                        than

            <h5>Conference Parity</h5>

            <p>The current structure of conference tournaments with pre-allocations for individual competitions will
                never increase parity within conferences.</p>

            <p>Individual competitions are not affected or motivated by competitive balance. In these events, athletes
                compete with
                their peers and can advance to face more elite athletes or move to the consolation
                bracket to compete with athletes who have suffered losses, ensuring that competitive balance is achieved
                within each individual competition.</p>

            <p>The nature of individual competition and systems based on it leads to the inevitable and desired
                consolidation of programs into larger conferences. This creates significant mismatches in competitive
                balance and the characteristic makeup of programs that join together when competing within the team dual
                competition framework. Only two conferences, the Big Ten and ACC, consist of peer
                academic institutions. The rest of the conferences are more accurately described as regional qualifiers.
            </p>

            <p>When team competition is the standard, programs have an incentive to work within their conference
                frameworks to create policies and secure membership that preserves their programs and allow them to
                succeed.</p>

            <p>The shift towards team competition will likely produce the deconstruction of many conferences. Teams will
                seek
                to join peer institutions and/or wrestling programs. There may also be the adoption of conference bylaws
                that standardize the conference's investment level to create uniform competition, like to what has
                been done in FCS football with the non-scholarship Pioneer Football Conference <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="Mat Stats 8: Can a non-scholarship Division 1 conference work?">(Gormley et al, 2022)</cite>
                and
                the limited scholarship Northeastern Conference <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="FCS: Bryant Joins Big South As Associate Football Member">(Herder, 2022)</cite>.</p>

            <p>Conferences have also taken enforcement actions against member programs for violating these bylaws, such
                as when the Patriot League banned Fordham from earning a conference football title or receiving the
                conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Championship for four years (2010-2014) because of providing
                NCAA permissible athletic financial aid in violation
                of a since-rescinded Patriot League bylaw prohibiting such aid in football <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="2013 Patriot League Football Preview: Fordham Rams.">(Patriot
                    League, 2013)</cite>.</p>

            <p>In Division I wrestling, it is common for programs to have limited funding. Many programs compete with
                less funding than is needed to fill each scholarship with an out-of-state or international athlete.
                Additionally, the impact of training and supplemental coaching provided through Regional Training
                Centers, which are set up to supplement Division I programs, varies greatly by program, and effectively
                increases the
                resources available to NCAA programs under the Olympic exemptions, remaining largely outside the NCAA's
                governance <cite title="RTC Criteria.">(USA Wrestling, 2020)</cite>.</p>

            <p>The implementation of competitive balance policies in FCS football conferences, however, does not
                necessarily mean
                a lack of success for these programs. In fact, these policies may not change anything for programs such
                as the Ivy League, which already prohibits member schools from offering merit aid to admitted students
                <cite
                    title="Without Scholarships, Ivy League Athletes See NIL Deals As Leveling the Playing Field.">(Diemeyer,
                    2021)</cite>.
            </p>

            <p>Team auto-qualification provides a path for teams to compete, and the individual qualification process
                offers an opportunity for elite athletes in any conference to compete regardless of their
                program's financial commitment.</p>

            <p>Similar to how limited resource programs in other Division I sports have been able to compete with and
                attract top athletes, wrestling programs would also be able to do the same, even if they are in a
                conference with fewer resources. Being in a less resource-rich conference would not prevent a wrestling
                program from providing competitive opportunities for high-performing athletes or from having a
                competitive team overall. In fact, success within the conference could provide a path for the team to
                compete against other successful programs. While some programs may find more success in team
                competition, others may excel in individual competition. This diversity of paths to success allows
                athletic departments to focus on the specific strengths of their programs.</p>

        <ul>
            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>At-large Qualification is a process in which deserving teams who have not earned automatic qualification
                to the NCAA Wrestling Championship may be awarded bids to the NCAA Wrestling Championship based on the
                team's season performance in team competitions. At-large qualification is also the path for
                qualification
                for any independent programs, should they exist. There is no requirement for conference membership
                to earn qualification to the NCAA Wrestling Championship.</p>


            <h5>Eligibility</h5>
            <p>All NCAA Division-I Wrestling programs may be eligible for consideration for at-large qualification
                provided they meet each of the following standards:</p>

            <h5>Process</h5>

            <p>Once the official automatic qualifier for each conference is determined, the NCAA Wrestling Committee is
                responsible for selection of the remainder of the championship field.


            <p>The NCAA Wrestling Selection Committee will select the at-large teams from a pool of teams meeting the
                above
                defined criteria. Outstanding teams from automatic-qualifying conferences and independent teams (if
                applicable) for the at-large selections <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Pre-Championship Manual, Baseball"><i>(Baseball, adopted)</i></cite>.</p>

            <p>The committee must consider objectively and without prejudice the competitive records of all other
                eligible teams. To the best of its ability, the committee shall select the most highly qualified teams
                to complete the championship field in accordance with the regional structure of the first two rounds
                <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="2021-22 NCAA Division-I Manual, 31.3.5 Selection of Balance of Championship Field">(31.3.5)</cite>.
            </p>

            <p>Additionally, the scheduling of additional matches not listed on the institution's published schedule as
                an aid for selection shall not be considered. If an institution encounters extenuating circumstances
                (e.g., natural disaster), the committee will consider a written waiver request <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Pre-Championship Manual, Men's Soccer, Women's Soccer"><i>(Soccer, adopted)</i></cite>.</p>

            <h5>Rating Percentage Index - Teams</h5>
            <p>For team competitions, the formula to be utilized for the RPI will be altered slightly to accommodate
                the
                possibility of ties. The weight given to winning percentage, opponent's winning percentage, and
                opponent's opponent's winning percentage will remain unchanged from the formula used for the athlete
                RPI
                calculation.</p>

            <p>The formula used will weigh ties as half a win and half a loss so a team's winning
                percentage
                would be calculated as: <i>(W + 1/2T)/((W + 1/2T) + (L + 1/2T)))</i>. </p>

            <p>Based on this formula, a record of 8 wins, 8 losses, and 4 ties, would have a .500 winning
                percentage.
            </p>

            <h5>Selection Considerations</h5>

            <p>The metrics to be considered by the committee when selecting at-large athletes are:</p>

            <h5>Dates and Schedules</h5>
            <p>Only team competitions held on, or before, Sunday, February 22, 2025 will be considered. The release of
                NCAA Wrestling Championship Brackets will be Monday, February 23, 2025 on an ESPN Network.</p>


            <h5>Benefits of At-large Qualification </h5>
            <p>Conference membership is not required for team championship bids or individual athlete bids in this
                system. Therefore, conferences can continue to operate with intraconference competition without awarding
                an auto-bid to the NCAA Wrestling Championship if they so choose. The Atlantic Coast Conference has
                taken this approach for Men's Lacrosse. Despite being one of the premier conferences in NCAA Men's
                Lacrosse, the conference only has five participating members and therefore does not qualify for an
                auto-bid to the NCAA Championships. However, this has not stopped the conference from preserving their
                conference competition without associate membership. Despite only having access to an at-large bid, the
                lack of an auto-bid has not hindered the conference's ability to compete at the highest level. In the
                2021 NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship, all five ACC programs received at-large selections, and three
                advanced to the National Semi-Finals <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="2021 DI Men's Lacrosse Championship
                Official Bracket.">(National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2021e)</cite>.</p>

            <p>The process for at-large selection requires programs to have a winning record, including non-Division I
                programs that can be bundled with Division I competition on the same date. This incentivizes competition
                between programs of different levels and between Division I and non-Division I programs. The dual
                meet winning percentage requirement for at-large eligibility is a key component that helps incentivize
                competition between programs that may not otherwise compete, and it further helps to balance interests
                between programs to provide a better marketplace for scheduling agreements. This system is likely to
                result in financial guarantees being provided to less
                competitive programs, increasing stability within the division <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="15-Year Trends in Division I Athletics Finances.">(Belzer, n.d.)</cite>. Financial guarantees
                are the third largest funding source for the bottom quartile of Division-I member schools and have
                helped to elevate the quality of the student-athlete experience <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    n.d. -ak)</cite>.</p>

            <p>This increased inter-divisional competition benefits the sport by providing more competition
                opportunities for athletes and potentially increasing travel efficiency for competitions. This increase
                in the number of home team dual competitions desired by student-athletes and coaches <cite

            <p>It should be noted the 1982 NCAA Wrestling participation across all divisions (7,914 athletes), when
                intra-divisional team competition was much more common, is close to the number of participants (7,673)
                for the 2020 NCAA season <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <p>The at-large team qualification process enables wrestling programs to qualify for the NCAA Wrestling
                Championships, even if they don't win their conference championship. This opens up opportunities for
                more programs to achieve success and establish themselves as top contenders nationally by transforming
                the season into a two-stage championship structure. The regular season serves as the first stage of
                championship competition, increasing motivation and performance of programs and competitors throughout
                the season <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <p>The postseason is considered the benchmark for success in collegiate sports, and the at-large
                qualification provides a way for programs to achieve national success without needing to win their
                conference championship. This widens the pool of programs that can potentially qualify for the NCAA
                Wrestling Championships and compete at the highest level of college wrestling which will yield higher
                donation rates from fans of various levels of giving <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    2016)</cite></p>



            <p>By not needing to secure the conference's auto-bid to qualify for the NCAA Wrestling Championships,
                programs have a greater chance of establishing themselves as one of the top programs in the nation,
                regardless of the strength of their conference. This allows for a more equitable opportunity for
                success, regardless of a program's location or conference affiliation.</p>
            <p>This path to qualification for mid-tier programs within the most elite conference will increase the
                rivalries within the conference, particularly for those challenging for an at-large bid, driving fan
                interest where there is currently a shortage of support <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="Team segmentation at the Big Ten Wrestling Championships">(Cooper, 2009a)</cite>. With the
                path to at-large qualification being within reach for programs who have traditionally lacked conference
                or NCAA level success, the significance of conference and non-conference team competitions will
                increase, especially those against other programs that are also within reach of an at-large bid. This
                will lead to the further development of rivalries for programs <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

            <p>The issue of teams overperforming their schedule, finishing the season undefeated, and not being provided
                with an opportunity to compete against top-performing teams within a team dual postseason to determine
                their program's actual strength within the national context will no longer be a concern for wrestling
                <cite title="2013-14 Wrestling Schedule.">(Northern Iowa Athletics, n.d. -b)</cite>. This limitation has
                held back fan investment in the sport, but it will no longer be an obstacle for programs that exceed
                season expectations.

            <h5>Benefits, Building the Bracket</h5>
            <!-- <ul> -->
            <!-- <h5>Bracket Composition</h5> -->

            <p>The importance of the NCAA Wrestling Championship bracket cannot be overstated, as it not only
                determines the number of participating teams, but also how they will be distributed within the
                bracket. The field of 24 teams is significant, as it is a similar allocation ratio for the team
                championship in Division I Men's Tennis. The structure of the bracket of 24 teams ensures that most
                teams (16 out of 24) will host an NCAA championship team dual competition at home, providing more home
                competitions for their athletes and fans without adding a countable date to their schedule. This is a
                highly coveted reward for programs and
                aligns with the desired objective of student-athletes and coaches <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    data-bs-placement="top"
                    title="Evolving the core product: Stakeholder’s perceptions of the NCAA wrestling season.">(Cooper
                    &
                    Weight, 2011)</cite>.</p>

            <p>Granting byes to the top-8 teams ensures the first and second round matchups held at home venues are
                more competitive, creating a better experience for athletes and fans alike <cite
                    data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    & Lakhani, 2021)</cite>. Furthermore, the
                structure of the bracket is financially responsible, as it minimizes travel for programs and allows
                for geographic assignment of opponents without seeding the first round of competition. This not only
                reduces the administrative burden of the championship and travel costs, but it also increases the
                frequency in which opponents within a region are likely to meet, cultivating rivalries between teams
                <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="All rivals are not equal: Clarifying misrepresentations and discerning three core properties of rivalry.">(Tyler
                    & Cobbs, 2017)</cite>.
            </p>

            <p>With half of all first-round, second-round, and quarter-final programs not needing to travel for
                competition, the
                expense of transporting athletes, as well as their time away from campus, is minimized, creating a
                more efficient and cost-effective championship.</p>

            <!-- <h5>Bracket Structure</h5> -->

            <p>This structure for a team-centric postseason will bring significant recognition to the programs that
                qualify, as team qualification for team-based competition has been universally accepted within NCAA
                institutions and by their stakeholders as a significant benchmark for program performance.</p>

            <p>These tournament-based benchmarks are the standards by which most institutions not only judge team
                performances but honor and recognize these performances by hanging banners in their arenas. These
                banners serve
                as a sense of pride for program supporters while aiding as a sign of the program's success for
                recruits <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="Hanging from the rafters, last symbols of success and pride.">(Glier, 2012)</cite>. While
                it is possible to hang banners for placement in national events, and a few programs have done so on
                occasion, it is significantly less popular as hanging a banner that says "19th place" doesn't have
                the same sense of accomplishment as hanging a banner to signify that your program made it to a
                championship competition for which few other programs advanced. </p>

            <p>Due to the significance of teams qualifying to post season competition being viewed as a significant
                accomplishment,
                team postseason qualification draws greater financial support from donors than winning records alone

            </p>

            <p>Though donor support is not solely contingent upon athletic success, it is influenced by it. Donors
                want to see athletic success as an objective way to know that their contributions are making a
                difference, and as such, donations are also likely to increase when donors believe that their
                donations could yield a material impact on the program <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                    2012)</cite>. Programs that have been on the cusp of athletic success, which can now be measured
                by team postseason participation, are more likely to see an increase in donations with the goal of
                giving the program the needed push to reach the milestone that is within reach.</p>

                Wrestling Championships historically being one of only five NCAA Championship to generate revenue

                    Go?">(National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d. -l)</cite>, the NCAA Wrestling Championship
                will adopt a minimum financial guarantee for hosting championship competitions.</p>
            <p>Seeded teams to meet the minimum financial guarantee in their bid to host will automatically be the home
                team. If a team did not meet the minimum financial guarantee in their bid to host, the
                bid will be compared with the competing bid(s) with a selection made by the championship committee to
                selection of the host team. (Note: A higher financial guarantee in a bid by a lower seeded team does not
                guarantee the lower seeded team will serve as the host team.) Site selection for first round matches
                will be determined based on a combination of factors including financial guarantee, distribution of
                participating teams, and travel implications for second round matches. Teams failing to submit a bid to
                host will not be eligible to host. </p>
            <p>These recommended minimum financial guarantees are shown in the table below and are established based on
                historic data and review of the established Division I bid standards for women's
                volleyball,<sup>1</sup> FCS football,<sup>2</sup>, baseball,<sup>3</sup> men's ice hockey,<sup>4</sup>
                and the individual wrestling championship for men's wrestling.<sup>5</sup></p>


            <p>These financial guarantees will establish benchmarks for the new championship structure, ensuring
                financial viability, and may be updated based on feedback from the first championship cycle as needed.
            </p>
            <p>The goal will be to continue to ensure that the wrestling championships continue to produce a surplus to
                support gender equity.</p>

            <p>Men's wrestling is one of only five NCAA championships to generate revenue for the association, hence the
                choice of location is crucial for the wrestling championship property to remain an asset for the
                association <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Where Does the Money

            <p>Higher-seeded teams are rewarded for their performance during the regular season by allowing them to
                bring championship competitions to their home communities and fans.</p>

            <p>The focus on qualification for the team postseason increases the incentive for programs to prioritize
                team competitions during the season which will raise the quality of the service and experience for
                attendees of these events throughout the season. Team competitions do a better job of developing team
                identity and
                building relationships between the program and their supporters <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip"

                they sponsor. This provides spectators and fans with a higher quality product, which is a factor

            <p>Team attachment is a stronger predictor of long-term sport attendance than interest in the sport
                itself <cite title="Motivational Factors Influencing the Behaviour of J. League Spectators.">(Mahony

                regular routine of attendance even when they are less knowledgeable about the sport or not even fans
                of the sport more generally. With most season competitions being team dual meets, a more
                inclusive system that does not require a large investment from spectators to understand the sport or
                the national field of competitors is likely to yield more spectator engagement in the sport of
                wrestling overall <cite

            <p>This system provides qualified programs with the opportunity to market championship events at their
                home venue, while utilizing the power and prestige of the NCAA brand, all without needing to
                sacrifice any regular season or postseason competitions from their schedule to accommodate the new
                dates. The financial guarantees have
                intentionally been kept low. These lower financial guarantees allow for ticket prices to be more
                accessible to prospective attendees which will aid attendance <cite

                programs, venues, and host
                organizations to submit bids to host without taking on significant risk while the model is being
                adopted.</p>

            <p>Through this effort, programs will be able to market significant events with championship
                implications to the local and regional wrestling communities after the high school and youth seasons
                have passed, providing athletic departments with the ability to capture information on attendees to
                these events for future marketing and fan engagement campaigns. This takes the success and
                excitement of NCAA championships events and turns it into a lead generation system for potential
                future fans of the program <cite

            <p>Financial guarantees are used as an incentive to encourage programs to foster a community around their
                program and reward the ones that have effectively done so by building a following of supporters and
                spectators. Selecting a neutral site for the semi-finals and finals allows for advanced planning and
                marketing of the event long before the participating teams are known.</p>

        <h3>3. Championship Venue</h3>

        <ul>

            <h5>Configuration</h5>


            <p>A single competition mat, raised on a platform in adherence with the NCAA Wrestling Championships Session
                Six standards, will be used at the venue with only one team competition taking place at a time
                throughout
                the entirety of the two days of competition.</p>
            <p>The venue should be configured in a manner that makes for an intimate venue. When the venue and
                configuration allow (ie: Hockey Arenas), there should be floor seating added to increase capacity and
                bring
                spectators closer to
                the competition mat.</p>






            <h5>Considerations</h5>

            <p>While financial considerations may make on-campus facilities a feasible option for the NCAA Wrestling
                Championship, the event should also consider soliciting bids from private and municipal venues and
                cities that may not meet the requirements for hosting the NCAA Wrestling Championships. These smaller
                venues and cities may have less competition for booking events and hosting the championship could make
                the event a major draw for the community, while also increasing the geographic diversity of wrestling.
                It is recommended that the venue have a minimum capacity of 9,000 people when configured for the
                championship. By lowering the spectator capacity minimums for bidding on the (individual) NCAA Wrestling
                Championship, the number of potential bids will increase, resulting in greater geographic representation
                and the potential for greater engagement of fans from around the country.</p>

            <h5>Administration</h5>
            <p>Prior to the start of the NCAA Wrestling Championship, participating teams must submit their championship
                lineup forms.</p>
            <p>A maximum of 22 athletes may be declared on the form. Competition within the championship shall be
                limited to only the athletes listed on this form. To be listed on the form, athletes must be
                physically able and eligible to compete. Student-athletes injured to the point of not being able to play
                (e.g., broken bones, etc.) or student-athletes who have been declared as redshirts or student-athletes
                who are not eligible for NCAA, conference or institutional reasons, cannot be listed on the lineup form
                and cannot travel to the championship events <cite data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top"

                    adopted)</cite>.</p>

            <h5>Size</h5>
            <p>The first round, second round, and quarter-final contests, traveling parties will be limited to 13
                student-athletes and five (5) non-athletes. For the championship site (semi-finals and finals) the
                number of student-athletes in the traveling party is raised to 20.</p>
            <p>Each round's travel party may include a different composition of student-athletes if the
                athletes were listed on the team's lineup form.</p>
            <p>The travel party size is in keeping with the established travel policies for NCAA championships <cite

        <h3>E. Impact to Team Standing</h3>



        <p>For there to be universal acceptance of a new system, we need to ensure that programs from all
            conference types can compete within the framework. One way to do this is by awarding auto-bids to
            each conference, which adheres to NCAA principles and provides a path for all programs to compete in the
            championship. It's also important to consider the standing of autonomous conferences (sometimes referred to
            as the "Power Five") compared to non-autonomous conferences <cite
                title="NCAA board of directors approves autonomy for ‘big five’ conference schools.">(Babb,
                2014)</cite>. The goal is to ensure that any policy change
            does not unduly impact any group of programs.</p>
        <p>When we analyze the team dual performance (RPIs)
            and NCAA placements of these two groups, we do not see a significant deviation. Autonomous conferences may
            slightly benefit more in an individual-centric format, while non-autonomous conferences may have a higher
            standing based on their dual performance as calculated within the RPI. However, the difference is not
            significant and may even disappear with a larger sample size. There is a correlation between a team's dual
            performance and their individual performance, which suggests that the standings between these two groups
            would not be significantly impacted under a new system. Furthermore, the relative national ranking for
            programs within the individual framework and the team competition framework did not differ significantly
            based on the number of national qualifiers for the program.</p>

        <ul>
            <h5>Team Standing by Conference Type</h5>
            <p>Calculating each program's RPI based on the results of the team dual competitions they wrestled within a
                season; we do not see a significant deviation from their dual performance and their actual performance
                at
                the NCAA Championship under the individual-centric format.</p>
            <p>While the results of team competitions might be slightly different had teams been judged based on these
                parameters, there is no evidence to conclude that autonomous or non-autonomous conferences would be put
                at
                an advantage or disadvantage within a team centric system.</p>

            <h5>Team Standing by Number of Qualifiers</h5>
            <p>Looking at a comparison in the performance of teams at the NCAA Championships under the current format
                and in
                those programs standing within a team competition format, we see very similar results for the average
                performance under each format for programs based on their number of qualifiers to the NCAA Championship.
